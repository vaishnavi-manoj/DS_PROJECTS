I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,Depression
6983,"I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to 100",Depression

I am really clingy, a thing which he usually loves about me but right now I kind of have a feeling that I am doing too much.Any suggestion will be gladly accepted, be frank and tell me how I can not make it worse: its that that bothers me.

This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry.

6993,"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why",Depression
6994,"Did your depression start after a time of serious stress/anxiety? If so, this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why",Depression

But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??",Depression

7000,"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything.

I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time?

I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is.

My nerves are shot, I am stressed, I am struggling to pay my bills, keep my car on the road, still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about $100 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer, then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money, and happiness, and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on, but I have kept a lot of it from her, she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head.

I have just been alternating between drinking and crying, mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time, we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine.

7018,"Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy.",Suicidal

7029,"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go.

7030,"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions.",Depression

My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions.

7048,"19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please",Depression

I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior.

7061,"Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not ""feel"" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5, I think my reaction honestly would be ""meh"". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things.

I am single, I have no career, no degree, no money and have nothing going on in my life. But the odd thing was before that night I was still hopeful about things turning around in my life.

7064,"tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night",Depression

7066,"I have posted about it several times, but here goes. 12 months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had 2 children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me. She said she was going back to that lifestyle and it left me a broken man. I would loved her, forgiven her several times, I would been looking after her children. I did absolutely everything I could for them. I am just left with pain. I will not commit suicide, but the pain has been so bad I have thought things like: ""when I am gone I will not be in this pain"".she is blocked me on everything.

7067,"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

7078,"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",Depression
7079,I do not care if anyone reads this or upvotes. I just need to ask why I cannot just be happy? Why cannot I be normal and enjoy things anymore? Why does it have to suck? Why does not anything make it better? Why cannot I be happy for what I know are good things around me and in my life? Why did not I bring my gun today to end this? Why? Sorry. Why?,Depression
7080,"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.",Depression
7081,"Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app, and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual. I enjoy his company and I think the feeling is mutual. The problem is, there is this growing nagging feeling on the back my head that everything is bound to turn bad. I am already imagining all kinds of break-up scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by, and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up. He does not know about my depression and I do not plan on telling him so big a skeleton as early as now. How do I possibly deal with this?

7085,"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane.

They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about.

He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day.

7094,"I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate, the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon, unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room.

For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you.

Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on.

I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon.

Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

I am scared that I will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weak-ass, ungrateful low-life.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.I have never once tried to self-diagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation.

I have thought of killing myself thousands of times: of jumping from a five-story building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that I am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that I will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo.",Suicidal

They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

Growing up, I was bullied alot, but I can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as I grew, my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the Dark Day, an argument so drastic, that I had to kick myself out, to my wife's (girlfriend then) house. For awhile, I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife (who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic). I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die.

7160,"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home.

I am starting to doubt myself, am I the problem? What is it that I say that turns people against me? I swear I try my best to stay respectful and not offend anyone.. I swear their words get to me easily2. I hate my body and my looks so much. Literally every girl I see on the internet looks prettier than me. I see a lot of girls on the internet who do not look like they alter their photos but idk if they do.. nonetheless it makes me feel terrible to be this ugly. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror for longer than 5 seconds.. I do not even want to leave the house anymore because I hate how I look. I am considering getting surgery to fix my face but at the same time I am too scared to do it3. I feel like an idiot for being slow and not understanding many things I see. I want to be a part of the conversation but I am too afraid to ask because I might get bullied for not understanding something. 4. I suffer from a lot of health issues and most of my health problems are on my skin which makes me insecureAll of these reasons are taking a toll on me, ik my problems might not sound as bad as other problems which makes me feel bad about myself, I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about problems that might sound unrealistic, I am sorry if it sounds that way I am trying to be a better person and get over things because I am told to just get over it so I am trying but its hard At this point, the suicidal thoughts are carved into my head, they just will not go away, it feels like I could escape them for a short time if I harm myself maybe I keep having suicidal thoughts all day everyday for multiple reasons",Suicidal
7163,"I think I have been depressed for a little over 5 years now, and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area, I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago, and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful, like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me, slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress, and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you; I love my parents deeply, but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind, I get no pleasure from it, and I do not beat myself bloody, but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now. If I land the job it will mean moving away to pursue the work, but on the other hand I think getting away from my family and having my own space will ultimately do me some good in the long haul.

I have been doing a course that has been extended by a year due to COVID, lockdown after lockdown. I live at home, I am not in a relationship, I feel like a fucking loser. I have lost friendships, made a friend who tried to make it more than friendship which was not what I wanted. I cannot go on vacation, I just need a break.Today was the last straw, I applied for two jobs weeks ago. I got one of them, then they never replied for 6 weeks.

7171,"Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (26 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!",Depression

7175,"I am a 24 yo male. All throughout my life, I feel like I ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""Introduction to Beer"" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. I might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung, but that is a bet I am going to have to make. I am not posing a question here.

You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that : we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared.

Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations.

7207,"IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, I am 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started ""real life"") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such. &amp;#x200B;In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I am at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there is no magic cure and its something I will have to live with. That being said, I do not side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I do not think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face. &amp;#x200B;At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you are good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I do not blame them for it because it should not be expected of them. I do not think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.&amp;#x200B;Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I do not really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases). &amp;#x200B;A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. ""Institutions"" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off. &amp;#x200B;Conditions like Aspergers are not much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies do not naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with ""disabilities"" or doing something else of little respect. I am actually personally looking into doing sex work.&amp;#x200B;I certainly do not see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I am not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just does not work. I will say that one benefit (there are not many) is I do think I am a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there is no shame in what they are doing. I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death",Suicidal

It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends.

7232,"So as title states. I had ran out of medication. I tried to get it refilled , made a few calls to my psychiatrist office left a couple messages. Even spoke to someone days before it supply ran out. But in the end it was not refilled. Mind you I had not had an appointment since maybe January as I missed my last telephone appointment sometime in spring I believe. I was on the max dose of the prescription , I had been on this since the end of 2017 although my dose was not maxed out till around the start of 2019 if I recall correctly. I had been skipping doses here and there but never more than 2 days at a time sometimes I would forget if I had taken my dose for the day and most times I elected not to take said possible missed dose for that day in the event that I did take it. So I am wondering what to expect in the coming weeks or months. Mind you I have a lot of other mental impairments aside from severe depression and bipolar. Some I do not even know anything about. I am currently not sleeping too much , it is a lot more difficult to fall asleep now. I am having brain shocks and what not often. I feel like I used to prior to taking this medication. Extreme tiredness , slurring my words often , not feeling alive at all. (Even on the medication I felt tired and weak but it was not as bad as it is while off it)I wake up early now and after being up maybe .. 5 hours I start to feel so tired and have 0 energy but cannot nap/sleep While off the medication , if I go for a walk or exercise I get this high and feel like I can do anything (lol) while on medication I did not really get that even after doing those activities. This is a lot to read and I am sure I confused anyone who has made it this far. But I am hopeful to get some kind of response. (I have an appointment with a new mental health professional in 2 weeks) if that matters I ran out of Citalopram about 8 or so days ago. what is going to happen?",Depression

7238,"I have been close to my friend for four years, in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own. We got in a lot of fights, mostly about respecting each other, since he never respected me. I made mistakes in the friendships, he made some overly bad mistakes. I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end. Throughout the friendship, I helped him so much, paid for so much, bought him things to make him happy, and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long, just so he could be happy. So many things, because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life, and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship. Fast forward near our graduation, he gave me covid-19, and throughout covid 19, my dad passed away when I got symptoms, and I had to be locked in a small room throughout, and I never got to see my dad in his last moments/ when he passed. I stood in a room shaking, and that same idea torment's my soul, and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me. When I had covid, he would not let me tell any of our friends, he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him, and others. I was threatened, and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition. The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends, and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him. Throughout this incident, a month later he ended up cutting me off for reason's that I regret, but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me, and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother, and forced it upon me and him, and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls. At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons, lies were being told. In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself, and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me. Now it continues that I am losing my other friends, I have fallen into depression, and he is slowly making everyone hate me. The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself, but nothing has gone good. Every single week something worse happens, and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore. I do not want to go throughout life, my life is over, my dad is gone, and everything is just garbage. It comes to the point where I cannot even explain this situation because it is so long, and it is so fucked up. I just wan't to be happy again, but i will truly never find happiness.

7248,"When I was younger, in my childhood, I had self worth, I still had anxiety, but I felt like I was the best at everything. I was a ""gifted"" child and did well in school, in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back. Either way I felt special and unique. I have had worrying behavior before where I would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler, I would bang my head against the wall or floor. Still. Those things were rare of me though maybe I should I have taken it as a sign of things to come. In middle school I was anxious but I still felt nice and special. 9th grade was when things changed though, I started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself, I started seeing myself in a negative light, and the only way I coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing. There were times I made threats to the students that were bullying me, but instead of thinking it was wrong, I doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat. After 9th grade I felt better going to another high school, I was not getting bullied, and even though I was not quickly making friends, people still let me hang around them or sit at their table. It was nice. I met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years. He ended up leaving me during my first semester of college. I felt sad about it, but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy. I was quite wrong. Not only that but I started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while I realized I was not. I was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough. However, this world requires you to contribute something to it. I could not. The former gifted child felt lied to. That I could do anything and I had great potential. It bothered me a lot. I did not feel like I could conquer anything like I used to. Instead, I was smacked in the face with the truth that I was not special and my best was not good enough. Through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and I eventually will get good. I did not see any improvement, in some areas I felt like I was getting worse. Right now I am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts. I am not quite doing anything for this world, in a way I feel like I am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual. Recently I looked through documents of tests that were done when I was younger in elementary school. I found that I lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety. I thought my IQ may have been better but I tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating. Right now I am not sure how to move forward... but I am too scared to kill myself. I have never been good enough. .",Suicidal

Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything.

That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine.

I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me.

It hurts so goddamn much you would not believe, but then I go ahead and just do it to myself again.I see it as something almost akin to climate change, as depressing as that sounds. Like the worst part about this inescapable loop, is that it is inherently completely avoidable if I simply did the work. But I cannot bring myself to do it so I do not know what to do, and every second of inaction is another assignment missing, so I am watching my possibilities burn with fear as I stand like a deer in the headlights. &amp;#x200B;I am powerless to my inability to work and I cannot strive nor see myself striving to do anything other than work.

7320,"my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speaking(texting) to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby :( so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel, but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post, triggering convo w/ brother",Depression
7321,"All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. ""You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller"", ""I would date your second chin"". And I think that some of these ""roasts"" could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6"". But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment, I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on, recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical, arrogant, a-hole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking, paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away.

7323,"I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my ""hometown"" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this, know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish, I would ask to have never been born. obviously, there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now.

Even when I have people that love me, friends, hobbies, life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide, but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die, and in the end, i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go.

But almost 30 minutes ago after I washed my face and cleaned my hair, i feel amazing about myself. This happens EVERY DAY. I get really suicidal because I loose my plans for the future, and because I am very self conscious about my looks, to the point where I have tried to cut my nose to make it look better (but failed). This lasts for about 90 percent of the day, but then at around 10 percent of the day (usually occurring at night) I feel like I am beautifal and that I feel amazing about myself (but I still do not see my future for myself as I lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day). I have been diagnosed with depression before, but I lied to my therapist because I did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her I was ok, so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that I am getting a ton better, (they think I am doing better because I get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression) but I am not.

As a child, my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21, I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years, she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that, I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again, I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with.

7340,"I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this.

7344,"Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 24/7. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However, I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues, but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression, so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am, but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing (haha) essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.",Depression

I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged.

7349,"I have been trying to understand what that compulsion is I felt when I wanted to die. I know this is a tricky question because it would be so deeply personal and individual to everyone, but I am curious if anyone can lucidly explain everything going on during this moment.For me all I remember was there was many terrible things happening to me and I was trying to just go about my regular day and as I was travelling in my wheelchair I stopped. My head was telling me that I needed to drive onto the highway and go in front of the trucks that we are approaching.I just froze and sat in that feeling and those thoughts crying trying to understand what it all was. I had idolised about death and thought about it a lot but that was the first moment where my instincts were telling me to go and do it there and then.Is this similar to everyone else? Just a spiralling of terrible thoughts and Realisations leading to the strong desire to die? Or are there other nuances to it? What is in that moment?",Suicidal

But I did not and now I am 19. I do not want to really get into details but believe me when I say the past 3 years have been hell I am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own.

And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them.

7361,"How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation.

They would not have anyone to take care of them. that is what they would miss. And maybe they should. I have told them countless times how I feel. They do not care.

7364,"Before I start, I promise I will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever I see them. I have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). On my birthday in June, I told myself I will end things an year from then (provided things do not get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I have wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. But, my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I have gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things do not get better (i.e. I do not land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there is too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I have run out of time to achieve things......it is too hard to turn things around. If you have made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts. I have had enough (In tears as I type this)",Suicidal

Outcast amongst outcasts, it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us. Not to mention other LGBT people and obviously everyone else. I read that like 87% of people would not even date a trans person, so I am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people. Which makes everything very isolating. There is no way in the world I could even date in my current state, but even if I could I would never find anyone nearby. I thought the first step would be going to therapy, but that is over.

Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school.

On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem.

Six hospitalizations, lots of med changes, stress, career disasters, relationship disasters, and substance abuse (alcohol).I have been sober for many decades, got to retire at 50, have no financial worries. Never got married and that one really bothers me some times. I was successful, high average attractive, sales for big corporations so had money.

That makes me feel really inferior, weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record, I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants.

7415,"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not.

7429,"I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out, but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother (X): My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind (we are 11 years apart), and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years, X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came, he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 16-21, he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent (grabbing my ass, slapping my ass, getting on top of me, removing my clothing, forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering, and looking at me naked, etc.). No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic, and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend, but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother (Y): Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately, the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him, my mom, and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot, and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education, extracurricular, social life, and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support, Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom: This is, of course, the most complex relationship I have. However, I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child, does not allow me to see friends, constantly making homophobic remarks (does not know I am gay), constantly offending my expression or lack thereof, does not support any of my decisions, forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike, cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. - But she needs me to take care of Y, translate every document, upkeep the house, etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used, disrespected, neglected, uncomfortable, abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself- but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic, I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not.

7445,"As the title says, I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.5-17 (24 now) and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. My youth has been taken away from me and I feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.I have no idea what is the point of this post, but anyway, thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week.

7448,"Hi, I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all, but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life, I had everything I needed to this day, my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it, I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social, I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me.

First my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months. Then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and I am trying so hard to get her better but I am failing. Then an animal at work that I have been really close to died while under my care. I have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul. People generally repulse me. So, people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much, but for me it totally stops my life and takes me over.The anxiety about my dad being OK is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless, I could not save him.. what the he will am I even there for then? And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead. I would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade. I have not slept in 4 nights because I have been watching over her. And now awaits another sleepless night. And then tomorrow I have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and I will not be able to watch her and I will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow working.My partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles I just feel so alone.The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that I would fail my cat, she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and I am responsible for her. But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to.

All I have had was myself to keep me from totally giving up, telling myself ,to hang in there, it will all get better, I am strong, I am lying to myself. I see straight through everyone, everyone I have known have all been fake, I know they do not care about me. I have cried myself to sleep multiple times this year. I feel like I am the only one going through this even though I am not. I try, and I try to be the best person that I can be, someone who can be accepted by others. I want to die.

7479,"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",Suicidal

7494,"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

7514,"Hi, I am early 20s (M) in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional help/counselling recently that i self-referred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors(vague i know) and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland? Especially at this ageI appreciate it is a lot/huge ask, the amount I have went through just gets so overwhelming to process and I am just so lost and want guidance; i do not know what to do/where to go. I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees, and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve, which makes me feel more hopeless.

It was a busy night when I did what I did and I did not feel like a pain to the nurses but probably was to the doctor who could not understand why I was not immediately reacting the way he wanted me to. Well I actually did I just seemed to have a delayed reaction to the drugs I took for whatever reason. I am worried about my liver. I took a pretty high dosage and I do not understand why it took a day to react. Just a couple hours before I was meant to be leaving hospital I started to strongly react to the medication I took. I had all the symptoms. Then I spent the two days immediately after taking the overdose getting all of the worst symptoms. A bit while hospitalised and mostly not. The medication was out of date and there for if i ever needed to kill myself. I would have been smarter doing this a different way because now I have no idea what I have done?

It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal.

7550,"I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is ""for girls"" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my ""friends"" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this ""cool"" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of ""friends"" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said ""that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be""I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this ""one man wolf pack"" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated.

A lot of years were just us vs the world and it felt amazing coming home to him everyday. But then I found out I was pregnant in May. Since then, he completely changed. He has cheated twice now with two different girls. I caught him both times. I have no family, no friends. I lost my job. I told my therapist what is happening and she asked why I am even seeing her still. I stopped going to therapy and I am sick of them not helping. I decided I want to end my life while I am pregnant.

This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass.

I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this, I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure.

I have no idea how to get out of this pointless life, there is no point to any of this. Work yourself to death so that you can retire then die.

7579,"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200B;TL;DR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do?

I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past.

I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment.

Well while at the pool by myself just enjoying the wonderful Florida sun, these rich kids I guess they were about my age, came up beside me and started calling me names like a stupid F**got, a fat ass, I do not remember the rest. Why are people so cruel to each other? I have worked for months to she would the weight which I was at, and I am genuinely proud of that. But when people say that I want to just jump off a bridge. I used to be obese, now I am just overweight and I am proud of that. I have lost nearly 40 pounds. Then they talk about how I was dressed and it was just a lot. I got up and came back to my condo where I am now just bawling my eyes out. Like I am not gay, but if it was is that an insult like I am so confused. I did not ask to be here so why do people consistently make it worse.

We we had to hunt geese with rocks because we had no money or food. From there I moved to Sauk city to be with my girlfriend at the time and all she did was take advantage of me.

Before the abortion she would ask me for money which I had no issue with it at the same time she was selling nudes while she was in collage. I did not find out about that until three weeks after I had to pay for the abortion.

7610,"Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like ""i wish I was not alive"" to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but I have not had a similar episode since.However, today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any.

Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said.

7613,"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.

7614,"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never.

Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love.

When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss.

I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this.

7641,"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

When I went to highschool I did not really enjoy going to partys with people I did not know so I partied with my closest friends. Now when I have finished highschool I know that I wasted that time. I wish I was more outgoing, not so shy and did not spend so much time at home. I know that there is a lot of younger people here. So I want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time. Ask her/him out, you have got nothing to lose. you will get rejected? So what? Stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen. I wish I asked Eve out, I did not do it but I knew that she was into me. Maybe I was wrong? I would get rejected? I do not care. Start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me.

My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective.

I obsess about things, and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health.

7681,"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities",Depression

We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after, an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression, but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too.

I am having trouble finding new interests to keep me entertained and I am losing the very few that I do. I love my parents, I would be devastated when the time comes when they are no longer around. I honestly do not think I could say the same about any of my siblings, any secondary family members, or anyone else in general. I have become estranged with just about everyone.

I should be happy, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and clothes on my back, more than a lot of other people have.

Worthless. Stupid. waste of space, time, energy, and matter. the world would be better without me, besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things, the world will still spin, my family will move on.

I have family that would forget about me in a month, ""friends"" that do not even care now. I bring up my past to family, my parent told me its ""impossible for a man to get raped"" well, guess I am the impossible, happened twice in my life, once at 13 and again at 15, so I secluded myself away from women and now I have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship, and they do not understand that, not exactly something to bring up on a first date, and heh, never get second ones. How Pathetic, typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help, but the meds make me feel worse, all of them, the therapists push their agendas, no one is against you, they are only for themselves, but if I am not for myself, then no one is.

7712,"that is the question I have been asking myself, for months. I am underage (less than 15) and I think I can asked myself that fricking question. I live with my mom and my two sisters, my dad live in another country with another family. But I do not care, that is not why I am asking myself that. One of my sisters (14 years old) said (when I wad 5/6) that I was a big baby, and that I just needed to suck up my problems and grow up, because that is what adults do. I was 5, why the fvck you want me to act like an adult ?! But I was little, and she was the sister I admired, so I did it. My other sister (17 years old) was the one that I was not really talking to, because of our age difference. But we had the same interest (book, anime, japan, culture...) so we started talking more and more together. But I sincerelly regret it. She thinks that just because she is older than me, she can do what my mom do (scolding me when I do something wrong and all that). And she think it, but WAY too much. Example: one of the day her best friend was home, I did some noise will drinking my chocolate milk and she smashed my head on the cup, and I started crying and bleeding. Her friend told her that she was exagerating and to say sorry or help me but no, she think it was the right thing and she does not cared. Example 2: I started fighting with her (verbally) and she pinned me against the sofa, hurting my shoulders and I pushed her in stomach so I cn go to my room. But there, my other sis (14) literally started beating me up, till I was on the floor, crying and screaming: ""stop ! It hurts ! Stop fucking beating me !!!"" And my sis (17) said: ""stop ! do not get physical !"" But she was the one pushing me on the sofa. When I called my mom, she said she did not want to know anything. Example 3: yesterday (27 july 2021) i was playing fortnite with my cousin (10) and step-sis (10). I am used to curse but they know I was sarcastic. I said shut the f up to my step sis and syam (17 yo big sis name) started yelling at me ""do not talk like that"" like i xas talking ti this bitch. Then she said things like ""y you responding"" (because that is how a conversation works) and at the end she said ""to you think I am your friend"" and i was like: ""well i do not pick people with such petsonnality as my friend"" BUT, since i wanted to finish that argument i just said ""uh... no ?"" And she smashed my head on the switch i was playing with. I screaming ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ???"" and pushed her in the stomch so that crazy would go away. In conclusion, i have a scratch on my face, that i will maybe keep 4ever. Yesterday, because of that, I scarified myself. Its been 13 days I did not do it. I do not care about the mark, but the fact she would want it on my face is what hurts. I tried to end my life multiple times, since I was 9. The first time was because a person in my family r^ped me. Since that I cannot feel pleasure in life, and even if I did forgive that person, she is still horrible with me. My sexuality is a problem. My mom said ""you are lucky I accept you"". Like if you do not think you will accept me, why you did a kid ? But some people get kicked out, so I guess I am lucky. My gender is a problem. I identify myself as a genderfluid person, but he/him pronous are the one I love the most (even if I use all pronous, even it). Who am I is a problem. I need to smile. Always. Even if I am just eating. My mom said these exact words:""Smile. I said SMILE ! Ugh !!! Why will not you smile ?? it is not like you are unhappy either ??? Do you even have a reason to not be hapoy, to smile ???"" Well do I have a reason to smile and to be happy, while I am not doing anything except eating ? And last but not least, what I asked. I never asked to be born, to live with my mother, to go see friends, to go to someone is birthday, to live, to be feed, to have a house or go to school. I only asked a few things, and one of them is to go see a therapist. I asked it. I asked it three time. But even if she said yes, she did not do anything. And so, what am i supposed to do ???I am supposed to smile if I am not ? I am supposed to stay with my mom because she fighted for me for years, even if she do not care about my mental health or well being ? I am supposed to let my sisters hit me, just because they are a few years older ? I am supposed to do things, but how can I do them if I cannot even take care of myself ?

7719,"I am stuck in loop of traumatic thinking. I normally think about suicide at least once a day, but its constant right now, it does not leave my mind for more than about 10 minutes. I am just constantly imagining killing myself in brutal, vivid detail. For instance, one of the thoughts that keeps popping up is that I want to shoot myself in the head and its like I can *feel* the cold steel of a gun against my head or on the roof of my mouth and my finger squeezing the trigger, even what it would feel like when the bullet pierces my skull. And that just one scenario. In others I slit my throat or my wrists or a whole myriad of other things.I cannot escape thinking about it and I feel like actually doing it would be less traumatic than the thoughts I am having. I do not want to fucking be here right now, I do not know why I am, I guess I am just too weak to do it right now. I wish I had a gun. I hate being alive, I do not want to live. I just do not have a reliable enough way to kill myself. I hate my brain, it insists on feeling like shit all the time and never getting better no matter what I try, now it wants to traumatise me so everythings even worse and it cannot even come up with a way to let me kill myself so I do not have to put up with this anymore.

7723,"I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now, but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after, but I had to carry out his will, handle his funeral, etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester, but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years, disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around, and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young, she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them, not even checking the grades. Letting my ex/not ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities, and do not really see myself with a good future anymore, just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems, and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest.

7724,"In 2016, after living by myself, I had to come back to my parents place. I was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.The 2 following years were pretty dark, I did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.In 2019, I finally found a job that was perfect for me. I knew the place, my boss was very understanding (regarding my shyness, anxiety etc), I was good at it, I got my first salary and the first car etc : Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time, meaning I was not earning much, and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. Then my contract ended and I have been looking for a job since last January. I have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea, super confident, but I barely get any feedback and when I do, we proceed to have an interview but then I do not hear back from anyone.I was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him (which I am happy about, my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives), and my brother left too, so now I am stuck with my dad I cannot even look in the eyes, and broke. I was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. That hurt too but I want to let her live her life with him, she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.I know I could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime, but as I mentionned, I am very discreet, anxious, shy, but also clumsy, distracted, and I am pretty sure that I would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications. I do not feel capable of doing anything I do not know alreadyIm very alone. I got a couple friends and I am thankful for them but my social life is far from being exciting and my love life is simply inexistant. I was relatively fine with it because frankly relationships scare me, so I was kind of at peace with it, but considering my current situation, that lack of love is adding to my list of what is making me feel worthless. Someone that could make my heart feel a bit lighter would not harm right now.If you read it that far : Sorry, that was a lot of self pity.

7728,"It has been 7 years since my brother died by suicide and honestly, life has never been the same but not better. He killed himself using a gun owned by my father and left a suicide note written in japanese ( he self-studied the language). We never saw the whole note since it was surrendered together with the gun to the police and my parents never wanted to read it. After his death, they burned all of his things (laptop, books, etc.) and never talked about the reason of his death ever again. There was always a time once a year when my curiosity got the better of me (I asked them if they could get a copy of it or if the police can translate it for us) and it always ended with disastrous fights with me against my parents. I always feel like I will never have my peace of mind if I will not be able to read about the letter.In the end, I always feel like the note could be some sort of closure for our family.Today, I feel like I just want to follow my brothers footsteps.

I am a 17 year old going through the worst of hell. My father cheated on my mom. He always wanted more. He promised he would pay for my education, he can barely pay my 50$ monthly allowance. While the kids around me are holding IPhones, sipping on Starbucks daily, depressed because their favorite musician produced a sad song. My mom always expected more from me. she is a manipulative bitch. She is Satan's daughter. she is always hated me for no reason. I admit I am a mess, I do not tidy up stuff, I am not that smart, I am not as smart as her firstborn, but I try. I do try my level best, but she does not see it. I scored 7A's and a B in my middle school final year exams, and she said it was a fluke. They did the papers too easy or something like that she meant. Whenever I try to be close with my own mother, she does not see me. She will be on her phone scrolling through Facebook when I try to talk something important to her. She recently told me if I do not do good in my final year exams, she is not going to pay for my college. Her perception of good is straight A's. Online classes are not doing any good for me. She does not care about my mental health or anything. She thinks of it as a simple matter that you can get over it. Basically, she will disown me if I do not do well. Do you see the type of mother I have? She highly praises her firstborn but she does not see anything in me. I helped her a lot with with her work, but I have never heard a thank you before. But I do not know why I still keep doing it. I show that I am okay when I am fucked up in my mind. I have an elder brother, who emotionally abuses me. He reminds me that I am fat and stupid everyday. I do not know if it is his way of showing affection or not. I am not claiming that I have the worst situation of all. There are some people having far more worst than me. I admire those who stick around when it was hell for them.I am sitting here, wondering if it is all really worth fighting for. I might as well live in the afterworld. I so badly want to kill myself. I do not know what is stopping me from doing it. Do I have anyone? No. Some people say that I will meet someone great in the future. What if I do wait, and she does not show up? Am I going to die waiting? I might as well die now when I have no one. At least I am not a burden for my mother if I die. Maybe then she will finally be happy.

I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes, it is good to exchange some messages and stuff, but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me.

It felt so insulting because as the neglect, abuse, and pain I experienced as a child were happening I prayed my heart out through tears only for nothing to happen.

If people are not truly caring about how you feel, and most people in the world truly do not care about anyone but themselves, find somewhere else you can open up at and consider helping others to do the same. Opening up on the internet is the only thing that helps me to feel better, opening up to friends and family never helped me out at all. I am alone but people on the internet have been helping me to feel less alone and I appreciate that a lot. I cut myself a lot and I am not embarrassed about it or ashamed of it. It helps me to feel less suicidal, and its the only thing that does that for me. I leave my cuts and scars out in the open for all to see. I do not hide it anymore.

My career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic, and I am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my self-hatred. Nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad, and I do not want to reach out to friends or family, because I am sick of the well-intentioned responses that make me feel to blame, or worse about myself.While I do blame myself for quite a lot, I do not blame myself for wanting to die.

7745,"I cried for the first time in years, the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers, we have modules, 60-130 pages of self-learning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career, its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more ""important"" ones, same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year, delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one.

7746,I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop.

7757,TRIGGER WARNING ..........I was violently raped in 2015 and I still have flashbacks. This is one factor in my decision to commit suicide. I am in therapy but I just do not think I can get over it and I think this is why I cannot make friends because it was basically date rape. And the fact that it was date rape fucks me up too. It feels like it was less of a rape because the judge claims that because I willingly went to the guys house (after meeting him twice at restaurants) that it was not considered rape. I am just feeling especially bad today. :( Kill myself because of being raped?,Suicidal

7760,"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

I lost a huge amount of my memory power, like if I have dementia, it is the most annoying shit. Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it.

7770,"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",Depression

English is not my native language (I am not from English-speaking country) so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general (if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it). Also, my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title, I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either, not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said, I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that, while still affecting me in a negative matter, I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture, not much else.1. I 100% have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well, not only this, actually, but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction, which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it, so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like, absolutely no one, even online. It makes things harder, but I learned to accept it, and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue, I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on, here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice on:I am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now, and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 1-2 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family (but no one is able to fix it), mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer, having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation, though she still needs to be in a hospital every 3-4 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital, but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other, he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well, hearing all that, I do not seem to be a good person, right? Like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes, and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either, I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school, I thought I would kill myself, but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes, I am an egoist. I want to live by myself, for myself, alone. In a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50% of my income to my family if the other 50% can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What, is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. Like, what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment, not really loud (I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this). And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax, I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like, I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice",Depression

7781,"21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet, socially anxious weirdo like me can do it, anyone of you can I rung a support group",Depression

I am currently in the job market looking to explore different nursing jobs, away from bedside that I might enjoy. I am looking into working for an insurance company to do utilization review. I have an interview today and I am nervous because if I do not get this job, I have nothing else lined up and I definitely will become depressed if I am not already. We recently bought a house that I am waiting to close on in about a month, our current living situation also contributes to my poor feelings about my life. At this moment I just feel very unhappy. Everyday is a struggle. I just need good energy. Thank you. I hate my life",Depression
7789,"Anyone else have immense trouble concentrating on shit? Can I ask how do you cope with it when you need to concentrate? I have clinical depression and my doctor tells me that concentration is one of the last things that improve when you get better. I do have my studies however, I love my major and studying and learning new things but I just can not fucking concentrate. One of the few things that bring me joy is learning new stuff but when I open lecture materials its like I have forgotten how to read. Nothing makes sense and I cannot remember anything I read. I could not even bake a cake for my birthday alone, had to have mom as help because I could not concentrate on the recipe. This fucking illness has ruined me. I used to be whip smart and very studious and had a bright career ahead of me. Now i can barely manage university courses. This fucking illness has ruined me. I have tried to be on my meds and without my meds. If I do not take even just one of my multiple meds my head just becomes so ""noisy"" and full of shit that concentrating on anything is even harder. If i take my meds the ""noise"" and all goes away but then its just the emptiness there that is keeping me from focusing on stuff. I know recovery is a long process but I am scared ill never recover or get my concentration back. I am really frustrated trouble with concentration",Depression
7790,First time posting here. There is so much on my mind. I just cannot find it in me to think I am worthy of anything. I work myself to the bone and get very little appreciation. Its really been taking a toll on me. I used to love what I do and now I feel like I am just taking advantage of. I have never been a fan of my appearance. Physical I have been overweight my whole life and recently been trying to change that but with the work I am putting in I feel like it does not make a difference. I just want to feel happy about myself but I just cannot seem to find anything to be happy about. Only thing that makes me smile anymore is my 3 kids. They are about the only people that make me fee appreciate in some way. That being said they usually want mom over me but I understand that. I am just been feeling worthless and I cannot seem to get myself out of the ditch of sadness. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any help given. How to find self worth?,Depression

7792,"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself. What is wrong with me",Depression
7793,"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)",Depression

7796,"Feels like the an episode of a soap opera, but the title pretty much sums it up.I am 24 now, and started attending university at 18. At 19 I got Pyloric Stenosis which went undiagnosed for nearly 6 months, I lost 49% of my body weight, and due to the impeccable timing, missed both the first year final exams, and the retakes due to illness. During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI, my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours, and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior (she survived luckily).It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder, and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to, they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did, and had an incredible time, got to travel to other counties to tour, was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify (huge personal victory) and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life. However, I have diagnosed ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression and Anxiety, book smarts just is not my forte, but I usually get by, until a global pandemic happens and I had to do my final year at home in my bedroom, this was my kryptonite, but I was still moving along fine. Up until about an hour ago, my father was taken to hospital by ambulance last Monday, traumatic stuff but we have a family history of being unwell constantly so I managed to not let it drop me getting these final pieces done. He called about an hour ago to tell me they were finally able to get a better understanding of what happened and confirm it is Lung Cancer.I do not know why is was the final straw but I have no idea how to handle this new level of nothingness My Dad just got diagnosed with cancer 22 hours before my final deadline for my degree",Depression

I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me, and if i pulled my arm back in fear, she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then.

I do not know what my purpose is on this earth. I cannot hold down a job. No friends. Most of my family cannot stand me. I have felt this way from a young age and I am now 25, it is never ending. I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life. it is all I was thinking of. I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling. The medication has done nothing but put two stone of weight on me so now I feel even more crap about myself. I am in a dark hole and only I can pull myself out.

7832,"This is literally the first time I am opening up somewhere, and not denying my miserable mental health. I am a 19 year old teen, and went through a painful breakup 11 months ago. I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help. About my life goals, I do have a serious passion for Physics and Astronomy. But I end up spending most of my time playing video games.

Its a struggle to even get up each day and when I do get up, its only to lay on the sofa doing bugger all.

I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine, time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing (fyi first time). Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope.

I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work.

7851,"So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means, if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was, that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me, other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live, Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did, movies, TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else ( of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything) I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend, our classmate, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy ( not the one I love ) told me ( because he could see that I had been struggling ) : ,,The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it."" and then the guy I loved said : ,,We are telling everything to each other. Tell us."" And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. ( for the sake of this the guy I love is : T and his best friend is : S)At one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying, exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance, when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 ( which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him ). I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. ( Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot ). S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S "" fooled around "" with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend ( M ) She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing, negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? "" Michael, are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you?"" Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that "" get some help"" because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists, psychiatrists, telling friends, group therapies, fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind, tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here",Depression

I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP - Holy shit.",Depression
7856,"it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually (though not easily). I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university (I am 21 now) and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.Since I am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time I disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like ""you should just go die"" ""your dad does not want you anymore"" or ""it is all your fault"" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago, I found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me (though I had a long day). I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition, I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. (it is another question which I always ponder at, whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day)Then recently, I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like ""why do you have to make a big fuss"" ""you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument"", etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after, till today, I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, I hope the grammar is not too bad. Thanks all I think I have depression but I am not sure, can anybody help?",Depression

I do not GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE FUTURE, ALSO BECAUSE I do not WANT TO GET THERE. My mom has also started teasing, making jokes about my cuts and making me uncomfortable in public.

I am just surrounded by people who want to pay me to fuck. The problem is that I need money because my parents does not want to pay me for clothes and food, so I will probably start this ""career"" even though I hate fucking and besides I am a lesbian so doing it with males makes me uncomfortable. that is another reason why I want to die, I have become a whore who prostitutes herself to pay her lunch and her clothes and that cut herself to feel ""good"".I became a human scum, I want to commit suicide without suffering but I do not know how the fuck to do... is there a way?

7863,"I am a 15M. I smoke weed as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression that gets worse at night. I also use it as a way to fall asleep easier. My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed, he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do, but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now, my dad is also having troubles with my mom, and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry, he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort, he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father, which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is, a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person, something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not, I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city, I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends, my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young, I do not know why I am feeling this way, it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal, nothing really even matter anymore.

Scanning, calculating, trying to figure out the absolute source but I know deep down there is no ""one source"". That does not stop my brain from trying before that critic starts to scream some more. It will not be long, but maybe I can track it. Figure out the reasons it surfaces but sometimes it just seems to be from nothing at all.it is a scary thought when your brain turns against you.

Nevertheless, you do not have the option to act for a change because it cannot be changed anymore. How do you act upon this feeling? Knowing that no matter how much you want to improve and move forward, it is already part of your life. It cannot be changed nor ignored.

7916,"Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this.

But it just makes me wonder, how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now, if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless, and I wonder, if everything falls appart again, will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again.

7930,"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore.

7932,"I am about to turn 18 and I am not ready. I never planned on getting this far, living this long. That selfish desire to end it all is still there but I am too afraid to do it. I look back at 15 year old me, feeling almost the exact same way, and wish I would had the guts to do it then. If I had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years, my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. Whatever momentary happiness I might feel when I watch a good film, or see a fox in the evening, does not make any of this worth it. I have not felt true joy in so long, I do not think I even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.I have completely wasted my teenage years. I have spent them inside for the most part, isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off, and other people got bored and left, and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault, and I should have tried harder to connect with people, but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. Now I watch them all, on Instagram, going about their lives and having a great time, and I am so happy for them, but I am also so selfishly jealous. That happiness they have is all I have ever wanted. If I could throw away everything I have, but be free from mental illness, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so exhausted. I do not even know what I am doing anymore. I am about to turn 18 and I have wasted my teenage years",Depression

By 10 years old I had already told myself that I was ready to die, not that I wanted to,but I was ready.This made me really unrelatable to my peers,I acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.By my high-school years everybody thought I was a crackhead because I was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and I never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that I was a loner,but I am full of social desire.All this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,I am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument I revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.Fast forward to now,I am 20 years old and I am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid. My mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disability,her constant drinking worries me.my 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went away,these last few years she has been following my mom's mold,smoking cigarettes,dropping out of school,doing nothing.I work 48 hours a week and when I come home I am 100% occupied by serving others, I have no future, no personality, no ambition, I do not even have my license yet,I am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanisms.I am fat and short,have an odd shaped body and just generally ugly, I have no redeeming qualities physically,I cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror,or work up the courage to find a GF and be loved,but I get awkward around girls I like and make things weird.I have no purpose.No place on this earth I bought really sharp knives on Amazon, but I do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as I lie bleeding out,I am waiting to get a gun so I can just do a quick shot to the head and get I over with,no more bad thoughts,no more missing the countless friends I have left behind in the 30+ schools I went to as a kid,no more pain, no more me.

Everyday of my life is a battle and I am getting closer to my edge.

I have so much PTSD from my life. In 2018 my grandpa , cousin and brother all died. My brother was killed by his friend on his own daughters birthday and my cousin was murdered at a red light in Los Angeles. that is not even the tip of the iceberg.

I feel like I have the same fate in store for me and I am just waiting for the day to come . I never liked living in this world and feeling all this pain and having no one to talk to .

7941,"I am 18. I cannot even bear a thought to even live anymore. Everything has been taken away from me. When I was small I was sexually abused by my cousins multiple times. I have told my parents but they shut me by saying that I am lying. I am still confused about how a 4-year-old child will lie. I was abused till the age of 10. Till now i stutter to talk to older men. Then I work way up in my studies. Even got declared as a good student in my district at the age of 11, but I manage to get only 6A 1B in my UPSR. (UPSR is a Malaysian-based examination for students at the age of 12). I did not lose hope and studied hard. In class teachers used to praise me being a smart student but only to get lower marks in exams. I do not know what is wrong with me and my examinations. Then PT3 happen and I got 6A 4B. I got into science streams. 2019 was the worst year for me would be an understatement. I was accused of cheating, stealing stuff by a teacher. I was removed as the head prefect of my school and president of the red crescent society of my school. I was falling into depression. I started to skip classes. Thoughts of hurting myself have always been in my mind. At the end of 2019, all the accusations thrown at me were proven wrong but people still treated me like I am some kind of a bad person. I just want everything to end but my friends always stop me. So in my last year of high school, I studied hard, despite the pandemic. I worked my ass off. My friends were worried about me. I just wanted to get out of my house and pursue my dream job. I wanted to become a doctor. In The SPM examination, I got 7A 3B, and 2C. ( The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, or the Malaysian Certificate of Education, is a national examination taken by all fifth-form secondary school students in Malaysia. ) I was exictied and thrilled, except for my parents who were angry that i got 3B and 2C. Well i applied for Matriculation in my country. Unfortunately, I did not get in bcuz my country has this quota system where only 90 % of Bumiputera ( Bumiputra is a Malaysian term to describe the Malay race and other indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia, and used particularly in Malaysia. ) while only 10% of Non-Bumi are allowed despite being a citizen of malaysia. I was very disapointed. I wanted to pursue A levels but my family denied. So i went for the second best option STPM, ( STPM is a pre-university examination in Malaysia. ). I got in science stream and i was happy. I later found out my parents have changed my stream to arts as they want me to become a lawyer. I wanted to become a doctor. When i ask the school administrators for advice they told me i cannot do anything. Nothing can be changed. I feel numb. I feel the world has stopped. I feel nothing is meaningful anymore. I feel my life has ended. I wanted to end all of this paain. I cannot bare anymore. I do not want my friends to feel guilty that its their fault. i just want to dissapear.

7946,"Severe content warning for mentions of eating disorders and emotional abuse.I have had binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a child, I would eat large amounts of food to cope with stress, as I have been in an abusive household my whole life. I have always known this was a problem, and I have tried to lose weight, but my eating habits feel uncontrollable. they have caused many problems, and in 2019, I was diagnosed with morbid obesity.I knew my problems were getting more grave than ever, and my parents rather than trying to help in any way, have scolded me, yelled at me and denied it being related to my mental health, and even denied that I had any mental health problems.It was not until late 2020 where they started taking my mental health even remotely seriously as I had a severe depressive episode that resulted in me not eating. I then got a professional counselor, and I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, and PTSD. I was prescribed prozac/fluoxetine to help with this. Even after getting therapy and professional help, my eating habits have not changed. Fluoexetine has also helped me gain more weight.Recently I have been struggling to breathe. Whenever I realized that my health has gotten this bad, I started bawling. I started to feel like my days are limited and that I am going to die before I could turn things around.Truly, I do not want to die. I have many friends I care for dearly and I want to at least live somewhat of a life for myself and escape my abusive home.

I do not sleep well, I will not eat for days at a time. I have lost all motivation and hope for the future. I am 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date. I have spoken with suicide hotline several times this month. Only to keep myself alive until the end of December. I think about my plan everyday and its the only kind of mental relief I feel. I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. Its hard to fake being okay. I am only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life. I am going to end my life in December.",Suicidal
7963,"that is normal. Not. I have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid. Suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid. It just gets worse the more i age. I am quite broken. My mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises. it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind. I was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die. Like the pyramids and the great wall of china. But now I am wondering, why bother. I feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging. I just want to leave this world peacefully. I am not sure which method yet. Some kind of gas probably, that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in. But there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method. Whether an exit bag or something. Exit bag sounded good, but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now. Like your last moments of vision will be in a bag. I am not sure.

She always tells me that when I am an adult I would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much. She just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise. My dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much, only a couple of times a week and 50% of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how I would die of obesity.

I deal with more than just my weight. It comes with extreme self loathing, anxiety, and even depression. The mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight.

Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.I have had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I have recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I am afraid to trust anyone, so I have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I am not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down.

While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things, and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me, he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts (started self harming recently) made me run, I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him, and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there, almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression, no one does, he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate, I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless, and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate",Depression

I think its time for me to commit to the decision or else I will end my life.I currently live with my mother. she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life. I am a gamer so of course I love to game and I can spend a lot of time on that. My anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college. I had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide. I still do not feel ready to go back. I am 19 and due to the fact that I live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules. I do not know if she means well the majority of the time. She says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because I am not going to college right now does not mean I will never go, I am just not ready. She constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes. I often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room. She gets upset if I sleep in late but that is my choice because I am not feeling well. I often stay up late and sleep in late, why should it matter to her?My experience with therapy has been awful. It took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response. During therapy I have just been judged and my issues compared with others, and it has never helped. I had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when I use it to cope with how shit life is. My psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job. She also told me that if my mother were to die Id be taken advantage of and used in the system. It feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me. All I could do was cry. If I am being honest, I wanted to shout fuck you and punch her, but I somehow had restraint not to do that.I am 19. I have a lot left to life (and honestly I fucking hope I do not but Ill just say that because of reality) and just because I do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean I am worthless. I do not understand why my life has to be controlled and I have to be forced to do things I am not ready for. College makes me suicidal, and so does my mother. I feel like its time to move out.The reason I am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice? I know there will be yes and nos, but I want to hear what others opinions are. I have been with my partner for just over 2 years and I have been thinking about this major decision for over a year. It gives me quite a bit of anxiety. I have never been to Poland, but we have met twice (would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic). I do not have anywhere else to go. My family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there. I also will not be able to bring my cats with me if I choose to go. it will be a huge lifestyle change too. My partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and I will have time to improve my mental health before I start making any big steps into the work force or college. Honestly, I feel like Id feel more comfortable doing things if I was there with them, because I love them and I am comfortable with them. I just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run. I do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different. I do not want to judge. I just hope that I will be happy if I make that choice, even though I know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe. Maybe Ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shit.I am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning. I do not want to go back to my piece-of-shit psychiatrist in a week.

8014,"I wish I had died last year.I could not create anything today. I could barely sing. I feel like when quarantine began, I was meant to kill myself. Oh my God, I actually *regret* not killing myself last year.I exercised a little, showered, sight-read piano music for literally 10 minutes, sang for about 30 seconds until I hated my voice, and cuddled with my cat. Right when I started singing, I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great, when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything.

I even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible, but that leads to other things that remind me of them.there is just no way out of this.

I have a disorganised attachment style. Meaning I am pulled between desperately wanting affection (anxious) to not wanting any affection at all and wanting to just end the relationship because I feel its an attack on my independence (avoidant) he said he loves me and will wait for me. I said I will only need a few weeks or a month or something to get myself together. I just feel locked in, like I am so young and will be with this person forever. Hes perfect for me. When I was feeling suicidal once he took 2 days off work to be with me to make sure I am okay. Hes a good communicator, he cares and loves me. there is no drama as I am used to in other relationships. So anyway, the night I broke up with him I got insanely drunk and ended up going to a former FWB house and had sex with him. I also messaged one of my co workers for sex.. so embarrassing because hes the type that will tell EVERYONE at work and make me look like a desperate slag. Then the next day I had to work, despite being super hung over. Like not in the sick way, just my whole body could not stop shaking. Whenever I tried to serve a customer id shake uncontrollably and had to go out the back and I ended up crying. Anyway to sum it all up, I am embarrassed, like I need to quit my job right now because I never want to face any of them again and feel like my coworkers probably think I am crazy and stupid.

I have screwed up being with a guy that is perfect for me, just because of my need for independence and wanting to sleep around.. like how ridiculous and selfish. My life is a mess.

She suddenly told all my family that I(me) was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen.

8053,"Hi all, I went through a really bad bout of depression last year (about 6-9 months) I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs.

I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine. Losing the definition of myself",Depression
8058,"There are people constantly telling me to hurt myself in different ways and the only way to get them to tstop talking is to do what they say but it is escalating and I do not really want to die right now. The other day I thought if I cut deep enough into my thigh I could cut one of the voices out somehow but I just ended up bleeding a lot and getting stitches, I also thought maybe one was in my tattoo but I cannot get the image off. I have scratched the face of the tattoo out with a boxcutter but it is still talking. My medicaiton is still working into my system so this is not going to stop yet.

Yes, I still have suicidal thoughts and do go back from time to time. But this method has helped me to reduce the severity of those situations. Another thing that has really helped me is learning to enjoy the nature like when it is raining or you are going for a walk in a sunny day. I do recommend learning to ride a bike because it has helped me a lot. My friends forced me to go outside and learn riding. It is not going to work wonders but the sense of control, to be able to control the pace at which everything is moving on the open road really helps you calm down, it just helps you be at peace.

8081,"This is a long post and is all over the place. I have to rant as I cannot ever physically say my emotions or feelings and therefore cannot tell my own therapist about this or anyone really. I have been suicidal since I was at least 13. There are notes as far back as 9 saying I might as well die to my doctors. My home life was never good.I have always said Ill die by 40 if I make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better. My guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older. I have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me (probably my fault since I get irritable). For reference, I am autistic (aspergers), have ADHD, anxiety and depression. The latter three since I was 6 years old. My little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner (leftovers, she knows I do not eat regular meals. I forget or food just is not appealing.. I am very picky and she knows me by now). Pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today, but its making me cry more that she even noticed. Maybe she did not notice but I know she caught on as I was crying as she brought me food. I know I have my own issues, but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and I just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family. My older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways. But I am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and I cannot be perfect. I have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when I was 15 when my mom got married (which I would not ever trade it was a good thing). I got my act together but instead just have the same issues I did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all. I have not dated. Never been asked out. I lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things. People say I am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial. No one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something. I realized I am starting to suffer severe burn out. Doctors notes say at age 13 I said Ill stay in my room and just not talk. I have done that since and did not even know I saw that. My memory itself it very poor. But here is the catch. How do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions? I always lie on impulse and say I am watching a sad movie (which is what I did today and I referenced a movie I cried to recently called Ride Your Wave). I do not think I can be vulnerable. Therapy and medicine has not helped this because I am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum. I either lie or get so angry if I have to express the truth, so I never express the truth. The anger is really me just being overwhelmed and I know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it. I was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits. To be fair, I hit too. My parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child. My mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once (they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointments).How can I be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when I struggled the most and it came off as anger? I got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since I got good grades. My own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how I am or how I feel. I just answer I am fine. Its stifling. I never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how I am or press further? It hurts. Sometimes I hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope. I am not completely hopeless, but 10 (25) years of working my ass off to feel like I have not gotten anywhere socially and I still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room. People say to just try/do it. I try it and fail I get overwhelmed and cannot do it again. I am trying hard and they know I am behind but it seems I can only help myself but I just have not been able to. I know at this point I need to do things alone but how do I start? Not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until October. Online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant I take. I am just stuck. Thanks for reading. I am just not sure Ill be here when I am middle age if I do not progress or even a year. Being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but I cannot help it. Why cannot people be more understanding. Why cannot I understand myself.

8084,"I will not lie, I put on a good poker face so that when people look at me it seems like my life is sunshine and rainbows. Hell, I have even had people tell me that it seems like I live a fun life. I am young, fit, pretty successful for my age, and not an ugly looking person. Underneath all of this, there is an insecure little boy that suffered from sexual assault as a child, severe bullying, had an eating disorder for 8 years, has mentally abusive parents/has been in toxic relationships, and has panic/anxiety attacks every night. I do not actually have any close friends despite having people that want to be friends with me. When I try to talk to people, it does not feel genuine or they have this expectation of me based on my image that does not reflect who I am as a person. Its exhausting that people think I am a huge ball of fun energy and loves to party, that is not who I am at all. And when they find out how I actually am as a person, it sucks because I literally see them lose interest in me. My family raised me and distilled values of perfectionism and reputation to the point that they stripped me of any bit of originality. When I try to be myself around them, I get told I am being weird or what will people think about you. My own mother calls me ugly and points out the smallest imperfectionsI go on dates and people just want to have sex with me for my body, and when I want to develop an emotional connection I get blown off - often times because the other side did not expect me to be as emotional as I am and it scares them. I feel like I have no one to be vulnerable with and it makes me feel so unbelievably lonely. The thing is, I do not think I have ever felt like I was not lonely. Who am I living for? What am I even working so hard for? How did I even get this far? On the outside everything looks perfect",Suicidal

8095,"I do not know where to begin. It feels like there is too much to say, and it all feels complicated. I do not understand myself first off, so it will be hard to explain my feelings to those reading this. I cannot exactly identify my feelings a lot of times. I used to feel true joy, the kind of joy where I felt alive and vibrant. I think I lost this kind of joy in about 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I now am graduating as a senior, and I still feel the same way. Its not like I am necessarily sad. I can feel ok, but i will never feel like the funny girl who could make someone light up from my jokes and personality like back then. I can never feel completely alive. I can never feel completely like myself. I guess along with this, its like I never feel truly happy? I am confused on when I feel happy or not. To be honest, maybe I am never completely happy. Its confusing. I would say actually that I do feel happiness, but its artificial. Its still really cool in those moments when I feel that type of happiness, but it just is not enough? Its like I cannot feel the same with people as I used to. I cannot bond with people the same. Its like I feel robotic almost in conversation? Not much emotion is there lol. I would say that with sadness, perhaps there is always a gloomy disposition lingering in the back of my mind. Maybe for so long, its so hard to identify it. For so long, I have also felt bouts of anxiousness. Even now maybe anxiety is apart of me and its lingering in the depths of my mind I cannot reach out towards because I can barely even identify it. At this point in my life I am just scared Ill be like this for a very long time, I simply do not know if I would want to exist if I knew Id be like this for the rest of my life. I already feel doubt in life, but its because I am so young and just getting into the world and discovering it that I have hope, hope that Ill change and that Ill go on to do great things and experience great things. I am so worried though, I am worried of different things at different periods of my life. It seems like I have new anxieties here and there while simultaneously feeling a sense of uneasiness always inhabiting the back of my mind I guess. I am just not me anymore. Life looks grey I guess. I guess its looked like that for so long that I feel odd even bringing it up, like perhaps its just not true because this has been my normal for so long. Sometimes I feel like I need mental help but then feel stupid because I feel as though maybe there is nothing much wrong with me, but what makes me realize truly that there is probably something wrong with me is the thought of staying like this forever. It makes me not want to exist anymore, and whenever I come to that realization, I immediately know something is not right. I remember whenever I was talking to a nurse about how I felt, but its as though she brushed it off as simply being my personality. It felt wrong, and I hope its wrong. I really hope I will not stay like this forever, and that its not just my personality. It does not feel like that. It should not be like that, you know?

8102,"(23 M) I come to this sub every now and then for something to relate to, to hear about people who seem to be experiencing life the way I am. It does not matter what life events are occurring, good or bad, people of all ages are impacted by depressive thoughts and ultimately suicidal ideation. I really do not know if I could ever do it. I think about it all the time, even while enjoying the time I spend alive. Recently more than ever it just seems like a real possibility, something to almost look forward too. I cannot think about it without thinking about the people who know me and love me, the problems it may because for them is the main reason I do not do it. When I think about it I also think about the larger picture, the reality of this situation. I understand that even in our darkest moments, tormented by our thoughts and clinging to life by whatever threads we have left, we still do things like this, like reaching out on this sub. As small as this action is, its so powerful. Everyone reaching out and opening up on this thread is so powerful, so desperate to live. Even when all hope is seemingly lost, we compile our thoughts and essentially throw a lifeline in an attempt to save our own lives. Think about how amazing that is, even if we feel so unloved, so hopeless, so lost, ashamed, abandoned, dreadful, or sorry, we still reach out in order to save our own lives. We reach out to beautiful strangers on this app to assist us in this journey of life, to give us just something, anything to survive, or at least make it easier to live a little longer. We are our own friends, we are the people who unconditionally love ourselves, we are programmed to keep fighting, typing a message and sending it on this sub is a huge testament to our strength as humans. You may want to die, but in the most sincere and loving way I can possibly say this, you reach out here, you read these messages because you simply want to live. I hope that no matter what you choose to do in your life you realize the power you have over yourself and your ability to change your own world. You are your own beautiful lifeline, whether you realize that or not. Here I am again",Suicidal

8108,"I had a fairly decent life untill i grow up and I always helped people who had a idea of killing themselves many times back in highschool so this is not a random topic for me, I believe I have changed many people's mind and helped them get better but for the last few years things started to fell off one by one.What exactly do I mean by started to fell off? The girl I met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school, family is also non existant, had health issues etc.I was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family, having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes I just got tired of being strong, acting strong, trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time with.And recently by losing the last person I felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important, having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such, I just got really tired, really tired, I carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow I am now exhausted I never thought I will be this tired in life like ever.I always been a observer but I am tired of being one because I cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and I am tired of seeing people being happy with something/someone I started to get jealous and question my life and found the details I ignored all this time.That questioning part lead me to asking; Did I really deserved everything? Because should not that be go like, bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky. (I know there is no rule this is just a random vent I guess?)I concluded on that I do not deserve to be alive and I do not fit in anywhere in life anymore. So therefore I believe that I should just give up at this point because I had enough, I tried enough, I fought enough.Funny part is I still love life, how things go for people around me as I said I spent so much time observing them and I like how good things going for them etc. I am just tired of mine going flat down with everything, literally everything.I kind of do not expect anything from anyone and I still have like a pages of things that I can talk about and the saddest part is I am aware of literally everything; my situation, what should I do, how I sound etc.Anyways this is the chaos going on in my head that I plan to solve by giving up,Thank you.

Cos I have no wants or needs right now but I still feel like not being here. I just do not see a point. I feel like my only purpose in life is to make others be happy or do anything that I can to make their life better but it still is not helping much.I just daydream about not being here anymore. There is a quote that I read: Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. and that is all that I hope for these days.

But recently I realized that no, actually, you are not very good at your job, you should have been fired years ago, you cannot get a new job, and you are too useless to do anything else. So my options are essentially to leech off my parents for my whole life or be homeless. Or, possibly, constantly get hired on for low wage menial work and be fired within a few weeks for sucking. I choose option 4 as I do not see any value in life anyway. My desire to not have my parents be sad is no longer strong enough to keep me here. Too bad for them that they took the chance and had a child. I am only partially delaying as the method I have chosen could be dangerous to people so I am trying to figure out how to avoid anyone getting hurt. It should be quick and relatively painless though. I just need a very empty space or something to counteract the toxicity after I perish. Of course I would prefer to have nembutal but getting your hands on it is such a hassle and it is hard to be sure you are actually getting nembutal if you try to get it from seedy sources.

8125,"Hey you all.I am a 38 year old male, married with an 8 year old and a 8 month old. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years now. I was passively suicidal about 3-4 years ago, but that feeling has since dropped of dramatically with proper medication, therapy, and leaving a life situation behind that I really struggled with.What I am really struggling with feeling alone and without people that care lately, outside of my own four walls.Growing up, I had a very close family on my mom's side. I have 2 brothers, 4 aunt's/uncle's and many cousins from those. We used to get together every Sunday and all major holidays.My mom passed away back in 2008 and nothing family had been the same since, especially for me. My mom was amazing - she was my biggest cheerleader, my confidant, and talked me off every ledge. After she died, My dad moved about 14 hours away. One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence, to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed, and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away, or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby, because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though, and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned, my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend, and we are super close. About a month ago though, he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life, but I was devastated.On the friends front, I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends, but none that I see or hang out with often - except one - and about 5-6 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time, I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes, I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community, but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90% of the congregation. Tldr - I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me, cut me out of their lives, or died. I am really struggling with relationships, and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die - whether self inflicted or not - who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls, and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for, and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there, and that makes me sad. Feeling incredibly lonely lately",Depression

My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I am their abuser and they are my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I am being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it is killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently cannot go to counseling.

That cardiac arrest is probably going to hurt like a MF, but my will to live is growing weaker by the day. What is the point of living anymore, I am tired of nightmares every night and the real world. Nicotine overdose might work too. How many cigarettes ad vapes would it take to kill ya? Maybe alcohol would be the better way to go, just get like fifty beers or something maybe a hundred. How bout them other drugs? Not that I have access to them, but that would be nice. I know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff, if I did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife, I would be gone in a flash. Well I guess I am slowly killing myself by smoking, so maybe I should stop that. Not that I want to, but I do not want some higher power being like ""hmm, you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you? Okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place MWHAHAHAHA"" Not calling it God, the abrahamic deity called God is so fucking childish, if there was really a creator or high power of some sort, it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him, getting angry and jealous, and having three different forms yet saying they are all one. Maybe there is no creator or higher power and the pre-existent bigbang has always existed. I do not know dudes, but I am sick of living, but I do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push ""me"" into an even worse place(or I do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that) I feel like I am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already. we are already in hell dudes, is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within, I have no idea, but I guess I will try again. Maybe some meditation or something will help me, this world so fucked up yo. How could I possibly know I have not been existent an infinite amount of times? Can you try to think back to what you/it were like before you were born? You cannot, or at least I cannot. Maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur, but there are theories for infinite universes so I do not know. If the universe is possible, then I guess anything is possible. Maybe I am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me, or maybe I am part of that illusion as well. who is fucking dream is this world? Or is this dream/illusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it. An illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk. I am fearful of the unknown, and I do not know anything. I do not have the courage to go through with it. I guess I am not starving in a third world country or enslaved in human trafficking so it could be worse I suppose, I am a whiny kid with a smartphone acting like a little bitch, but I do have my own problems I will not lie.

8154,"I met my ex-wife when I was 19 and after 3 months she insisted that we get married. Obvious red flag, and I knew that then, but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no, Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks, I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room, and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison.

I will do my best to care for my baby, but I am suffering. I would honestly kill myself if I were not pregnant/a parent to a child who needs me.

They fight a lot and I feel like a burden to them, but I have no alternative, nowhere else to go.They told me that I and their future grandchild can stay with them and they will support me. I would leave and make it easier for them, but I obviously cannot make this decision bc of my LO.I have no other option than staying with them. I am financially unstable and basically a failed human being, not able to care for myself (and my child). I am in a very bad mental state right now and I do not know how to manage anymore (professional help/hospital is no option. I do not have that much money and cannot expect my parents to pay. I already was diagnosed in the past but my parents basically ""undiagnosed"" me, as they know better than all of the mental health professionals I have seen in the past).

Nobody would consider blaming me.I am such an asshole for even thinking that, I know.I am so sorry my little one. Mummy is trying very hard to stay safe for you. do not worry guys.

Instead, I am paranoid about raising suspicion and have to avoid so many methods that would be quick and painless simply because I cannot risk anyone finding out. it is absurd.Part of me is disappointed that it was so easy to pick myself up and recover from my attempt.

Similarly, I have done this with pills, hanging, suffocating. Ultimately I just chickened out because I was afraid I would fail and survive it. Then I would cry and hate myself because I felt like a failure that I could not complete it. Anyway, I guess I have always doubted the legitimacy of the things I say to myself or believe.

On the surface, I feel like I have everything that anyone could ever want. I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain.

I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here, if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet, get a house and such. So its their mom, my old friend (11F), and her brother (9M). I am not really friends with her anymore, and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed (though he has not been diagnosed) and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting, but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects, but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed, (I have been diagnosed, so my parent are aware) and have self harmed (still kind of am). that is one of the reason we became friends, because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad, depressed, or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general, if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that (some in more detail) to my friend and his sister.

8209,"This may be long, so I apologize. I am 29/F, married and a mother. Let me begin by stating my husband is about as supportive as he can be and my child is incredibly understanding. All this aside, my depression and manic episodes are beginning to get out of control. And I honestly, do not even know where to begin and truthfully my story is not one really worth sharing. I feel as though this deserves a disclaimer that I do not feel right sharing my sorrows as I see myself being more fortunate than others. But I am so lost that I feel this need to post something, rather than continue hovering over this sub and other subs related to mental health, depression and anxiety. Currently, I am on 20mg of Lexapro and 600- 900mg of Gabapentin per day. My father was an alcoholic, and my mentally ill mother suffers from bipolar disorder, depression and classic narcissism. I was raised in an extremely religious family in the Bible-belt of USA. My entire life up until 16 was immersed in the Southern Baptist culture. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I did not see my father for 17 years. During my upbringing, my mother and father managed to marry 6 people between the two of them. Somehow during the later years, my fathers 3rd wife managed to get him sober. We reconnected when I was 20 years old and 9 months pregnant. I suffered for years from mental and physical abuse by the hands of my mother and her 3 husbands between ages 4-18. Needless to say, my life centered around their instability. I was the oldest, and therefore inherently responsible for my younger siblings. Being in a violent home, the anxiety I suffered was not acknowledged. I was the girl in school that everyone knew had a rough home. My friends were my escape and still today remain my chosen family. But the fact of the matter is, they do not truly understand my situation. I gravitate towards people who are not nearly as jaded. I leaned on my friends parents for guidance and empathy. I have always been the black sheep of my mothers family. I am creative, incredibly artistic, intelligent, charismatic and I am not sorry about it. However, my family views me as strange and always have. I was always told how much I looked and naturally acted like my dad, someone they hated my entire life. I have absolutely nothing in common with my mother or her side of the family, and frankly, I am extremely resentful. We rarely speak unless its a holiday. I refuse to have my child around their toxicity. My mother is on her 4th husband, and just as manic as ever. My father, who I had so much in common with, died from alcoholism in 2017. After years of sobriety, he lost his film business and drowned his sorrows tenfold. His death was gruesome. He died alone in an old farmhouse, during the August heat in North Carolina. His body rotted for 9 days before anyone found him. I can still smell him today. His death destroyed me. After years of separation from my father due to his substance abuse, I was so happy to have him back in my life. But he suffered from his own mental health issues and lost himself. I miss him every damn day. Fast forward to now. My husband and I have been together since 2008. Our child is 8 years old. I promised myself that I would NOT repeat the cycles of instability and abuse with my own child. I am proud to say I have kept that promise. My husband and I have always put our kid first, including making the decision just to have the one child in an effort to provide the best life. we have done it all. We bought a house in the suburbs of a great small town, we are part of the community, provide a great education, we are not religious, and we make sure that our child has an active lifestyle both in and out of school. We both work full time and I am a part time college student. Our vehicles are paid off and our debts are very minimal. Life is great, right? Here is where my own mental health issues come to light. I suffer from clinical depression and panic disorder. I see a physician regularly and have been on my own medication for a little over a year. My job is incredibly stagnant and in such a toxic environment. Every day I dread this job. I have been there 5 years. Now that I am educated, and have consistent years in a particular industry, I feel confident moving onto a better paying position and hopefully a better workplace. I have been job hunting for four months. The job market is terrible and the competition could not be higher. I have never been so rejected in my life. My car is beginning to fall apart and I cannot afford to fix it, or purchase a new one. My studies can be overwhelming at times and my professors this summer in particular have been hard on us. I have a number of hobbies, including a podcast and I am so lost. My depression is so out of control. I have no family support whatsoever, and I feel like I already lean so much on my husband. I am scared to lean more for our marriage will break. I write this because I am scared my kid is beginning to notice. There are days where I can barely get out of bed, unless it is for work. I wish so badly that I had my dad to call. He had his issues, but he got me. I feel like antidepressants only help me so much. Some days I just sit in my car and think, ""I could just smash this into a concrete wall and it would be over."" I feel like I am a rat in a cage getting nowhere. I have been going through recruiting hell trying to find a new job. I have had many phone interviews, several in person interviews and I am either over qualified, or qualified except one detail they are looking for. I cannot win for losing. Perhaps this is more of a venting post. Am I alone in this? I have always done a great job of putting my own issues on the back burner, pushing through the pain and laughing to keep from crying. But these last 2 months have made me realize that perhaps that was not the best avenue. This is the first time in my life that I cannot escape my depression and my manic episodes. Intrusive thoughts are ever present and beginning to worsen everyday. I cannot brush them off and feel so out of control. I just want to run away. Feeling out of control.",Depression

Honestly I feel no reason to be here anymore, I do not feel happy I have not felt happy in a long time, I do not know if I have ever really been happy honestly, the few things that bring me happiness do not feel real and eventually will probably fall apart like everything else and I am so anxious of that, that I feel like I am ruining it already, I am nostalgic for a time I have never had, for fake things and fake feelings, I miss when I did not understand and when things did not just so much . I hate my ptsd and I hate my mental illness. I hate how the people who raised me affected the way I perceive love, I hate the way the made me feel like I never will be and that I genuinely do not know if Ill ever accept someone not being negative towards me honestly my whole body hurts because of how said I am and I cannot do it anymore.

She cannot tell me certain things and does the little white lies to keep me out of certain things. I cannot stand lying even if its something tiny. So I decided that we need to take a break from a friendship, for a month, and I cannot stop thinking about her. After work, sent her a nice hope you had a good and productive day at work . I think she blocked me all together because she has not responded at all. Now I feel like depressed and miss my friend. FML I am depressed for making a terrible decision",Depression

8220,"I am sorry.The pain of living is too great and the reasons for me to stay are getting smaller and smaller. Every single one of you that includes my friends family and even my colleagues have supported me endlessly and for that i am eternally grateful. This is something I have given alot of thought and still i think it is not the correct thing to do however in this current moment i cannot stand myself and every attempt to fix the way i think has failed and the only person who knows me well enough to help is being negatively impacted while trying to help.for that reason i have decided that living is simply not viable for me as i can not see an end to the pain and as long as this continues the people i love and cherrish will suffer. Yes, it is a selfish thing to do and i am not attempting to deny that fact but the only reasons i can give relate only to others as i no longer value myself. Putting this here",Suicidal
8221,"do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16-year-old, who started high school last year. (In my country we start high school as 15-year-olds.) My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started, I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade (13-year-old me) my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just sky-rocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before, I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure, no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowball-effect. My self-esteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 6-7 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always: ""We know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. **You just need to try going to school.""**Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks, I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advice/stories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost, this is my situation",Depression

I have done therapy, I am on meds, I am so sick of depending on a pill just to feel ""normal."" it is fucking sickening to think about. Any time I break down to a friend they always say just how much I have going for me because ""I am so smart"" or some other meaningless bullshit. I do not have a bad life, I am almost done with college studying physics, I have both of my parents, they care for me. Of course there is all of the family bullshit that goes on behind the scenes, but everyone has that, so who cares. My gf loves me endlessly, but I feel like an empty she will, why fucking bother. I hate everything about our existence, probably just being dramatic but it frustrates me. Everyone is pitted against each other, we are destroying the planet and no one cares, politics is a nightmare. I do not want to be a part of this world. I am so sick of waking up every day to just go to work and then get baked as fuck. do not tell me to ""get a hobby"" I have done that, I always just lose interest. I have tried gardening, aquariums, woodworking, hiking, biking, running, gaming, every last thing just eventually fades to grey, just like everything else.

Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25/m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 1/2 years. She told me ""I am going to find someone better"" and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been ""beaten"". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for ""not wanting help"" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once.

I am a gay almost 25 year old from a big city and i had a good network of people in high school who still live here but they are all straight and i do not relate to them much. were not close. before moving back home i lived in my college town (another big city). most of my friends there were straight too and i felt different but i had closer relationships with them. since high school I have been deeply depressed and dissociated from my life so much i just showed up got the grades and graduated. no college professors to write letters of rec for grad school. credit score sucks. stuck in a dead end job here that i do a terrible job at because it feels pointless. it requires me to go into areas of the city that have shootings every day so I am always on edge that ill get shot or carjacked. it also sucks being the only gay person in a straight male dominated space. I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful, have my own place, live a life I am happy with, fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here.

Its so scary when you are brain is constantly telling you that you are better off dead. I do not really want to die, I want to be somewhat at peace with myself and just live a decent life. It feels like that is just not going to happen for me. Sometimes I truly think that I was destined to commit suicide. I am hanging on by a thread at this point and as time goes on the hope I have left gets smaller and smaller. I cannot make any friends due to social anxiety and now spend almost all my days alone. I think I have a decent personality but no one ever gets to see it because of my sa. I feel like everyone just hates me. what is the point of life if you cannot even make meaningful relationships with people? I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either.

Eh, I guess those things are not really that enjoyable anyway so its whatever. But nobody gives a shit what I think. I get no real support from anyone and its because I am absolutely unvalueable. I am the last person on their minds even though I try to say and do the right things. Nothing works and nothing gets better. Its always the people who I have talked to who end up happy with the last laugh.I will always be seen as potentially dangerous because of the examples of the many men before me. I will always be seen as a loser because I simply cannot compete with the billions of others out there who could easily replace me at any time. I will always feel lonely because no one wants to be around someone like me who mentions anything from this post. do not take what I say the wrong way, I am not blaming anyone else. I am not angry at anyone in particular. Its just about time I stfu and accept that I will always be unwanted. That other people will always have another someone who would they rather be with. That the negatives in life will always outweigh the positives. So no, I do not want to wait any longer than I have to to see what happens in the future. I KNOW my future, so do what you have been doing and leave me alone. I want this to be my final message before I am gone. Know that I am through trying to make new relationships and connections. Know that I am cutting ties with preexisting ones so they will not find out. Know that my parents would not care that much. Know that I have tried.

8264,"I am not sure where to start.. there is many things wrong in my life. However I do not think I have even ""lived"" to begin with. I am 17 since mid june and I feel like I have already wasted my entire life. I have never been in a relationship.(even though I have been asked out a few times before, however I have always rejected them due to several reasons.) I have never been to a party. I have never done drugs or got drunk. I have never had many friends and I have been bullied all throughout my school life. One of the people I have considered my friend in middle school, bullied and used me. She even sexually assaulted and tried to humiliate me with that in public. I have only realized that she was not really my friend later on.My best (and only) friend that I have known since pretty much forever, never texts me back. He always tells me that he forgot to check his messages, even though I see him interact with other people and post stuff daily on the app we chat with. it is been four days since we last texted and I feel annoying and clingy. And I am pretty sure he feels that way about me. I know that everyone does. I am nothing more than a burden to everyone around me. The only time I was any good was when I was groomed into taking off my clothes and participating in sexual roleplay in front of many adult men online when I was 11-13 I guess.. I did it because of my low self-esteem, body issues(I still almost cry when looking into the mirror tbh.)and loneliness, it was the first time i felt someone actually wanted me around. I now know that it was wrong and that I was sexually abused.When I was around 11 years old I have started to get suicidal thoughts and when I was 12 I have almost stabbed myself in the stomach Infront of my older sister and my mother. Both of them called me a freak and said that I was sick in the head. I am still saying that I want to die pretty much daily and they do not really care. Even one time a few weeks ago, I have told my mother before going to bed that I will kill myself that night, because I was so sure that I was going to do it. She again did not care. Just like when I was growing up, she was rather on her phone than paying any attention to me. I do not think my dad knows about all of that. Even if he did, I am pretty sure that he would not care either. My only (childhood) memories of him are just him yelling at me. I mean I was an accidental child after all, makes sense that they rather want me gone.I think I am destined to be a failure and kill myself. I was always the weird, shy kid that barely smiled. My house burned down when I was around 6 years old, which made me even worse. The only thing that actually still gives me somewhat joy is my teddybear that my grandmother gave me for Christmas when I was 3. I know it is kind of pathetic and sad but it was one of the only things that did not burned to a crisp. Something else that gave me joy and an actual reason to live was my cat who passed away. Tomorrow it will be two year without her. I miss her so much. Most times she was the only one who comforted me when I was crying and when I felt alone. The only real one. I am a maladaptive daydreamer, I have been doing it since I can even remember. I often daydream about my favorite characters from mostly anime comforting and being with my all the time, from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep. It makes me feel even worse and lonely. I use fiction to distract myself from everything. Scrolling through social media and seeing drawings and fanfiction of my favorite characters helps and it actually makes me feel happy sometimes. However those feelings quickly vanish when I snap back to reality.I know that I am just a pathetic and weird loner, who should just die. I have been going to a therapist since april and that does not help me either. I mean, I have gotten diagnosed with social anxiety and I am probably being tested for depression after I have got tested for autism in october. But who knows if I even live that long?I do not think that I will. My life has been miserable. And I am scared of my future. I am pretty much done with school and I have no idea what to do in life. So I should just take the easy way out.I am not sure if anyone's going to actually read this. If you do, I apologize. This post is a mess and I am pretty sure it is hard to read. I just wrote all of my current thoughts down. Also english is not my first language, sorry.Just know that I will not be doing it now or in the next few hours. Writing everything down kind of helped me with not committing suicide. But I cannot promise that I am not doing it this month or the next one. I already give in to the urge to cut myself, so giving in to the urge to ending it all is not far off, right? lol.I think I am just going to sleep soon. it is 2:10 AM where I live and I am pretty tired right now.

8266,"It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed, if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens, and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad, more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide, bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse, cleaned up their blood after self harming occured, having to see them in a psych ward, being afraid of triggering an episode, being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what, despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking care/supporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way, I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one, much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes, and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity, because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like ""how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression, fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up!"" and I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche, a therapist, and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now, but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having, these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me, it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this ""well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now"" and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression, i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said, I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one, no healthcare, I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support, you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden, but it is different when you live with them, you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside, except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this, but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.",Depression
8267,"Hi, I am curious to know how others distract themselves from everything they are going through. My boyfriend has depression, and he does not have any interests or a passion to distract him if he needs to, and since we have some distance I cannot always physically be there for him to be the distraction he needs. When I got rlly sad I usually was triggered by something (not always ofc, sometimes i would just wake up that way). I learned to deal with that by doing something that distracts me, but even when I was depressed I still had a lot of interests and things that I like to do or atleast that would distract me from whatever was triggering me. I just do not know how to help him in any other way rather than going on reddit and see what helps for others to hopefully try it out and let it be something that helps for him too.

They said I am dangerous and Ill end up killing everyone including the kid. They say that, and then say how my firiend is not ready to buy a house, but then forces him on a loan application to buy a house with the in-laws. So now, I am not going to have a home, my friend is locked in with his in-laws, his in-laws have taken total control of my friends marriage and now will not let me anywhere close to the house. Knowing this is how people feel about me (and multiple parties at that) it just brings me down. Ever since I went to the mental hospital, I have been treated like shit by so many people. I have been called a monster, a demon, a threat to society. All because I could not handle my emotions anymore. I wish I could talk to my friends in-law to their face and tell them to tell me I should have killed back then. Honestly I believe it though. I should have just killed myself back then. Its evident the world would have been better off without me, since people are so annoyed by my existence. Jokes on them. I am going to kill myself and make sure people know so they can celebrate my death. I hate this world, and here is another reason. The world has turned its back on me, and now I turn my back on the world. This is the end. People do not trust me purely because I went to a mental hospital before. Feeling like I should have just killed myself back then when I had the chance",Suicidal

8286,"I have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. I have extreme anxiety which I think ultimately makes me depressed. I put off dealing with the issues for years, because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. In my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. I had a lot of bad circumstances, but after I graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. A few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. I met this cute, funny, guy through mutual friends - and he asked me out on a date. There was an instant attraction. We talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. It was the happiest Id ever been in my life. I had a job, I moved out of my parents house, I had friends, and I had a loving boyfriend. My life was finally coming together how I wanted it. I thought, maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. I was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.Then - just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary, my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. I was completely blindsided. He told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be, and was not falling in love with me. He cut me off and never reached out, even on my birthday. My life fell apart. All of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.I realized that I am not valued or competent at my job, all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with. And honestly? I miss living with my parents and can barely afford to make it by. I hate my life. Everyday I go to sleep and hope that I just do not wake up. I want to disappear.

I struggle with suicidal ideation a lot and that is one reason why I want to tell my family that I have been struggling with depression so that they are aware of the risks.

He is telling me that he wants to give up on everything and I am extremely worried about him. He thinks that he is holding me back and that he is not good for me, and he admitted that he was considering breaking up with me because of this. But I can clearly see that this is not he wants, and he is just hurting himself by doing so. He also admitted he is trying to push me away because he is hurting me, but will not communicate with me about what hes going through or how he feels.I have tried as many things as I can think of: listening/being here for him, suggested doctor visits for trying meds/counselling, mindfulness, suggested exercises and to meet up with friends and family. there is more, but that is some examples. Despite this, he continues to tell me that he wants to give up on himself and keeps saying that we should not be together, quoting: I wish things were easier, I wish things did not mess up the way it did. But I just want to let you go because you do not deserve any of that and I will keep hurting you if we keep going But I am 100% sure that he does not want to give up on us and that he is just so deep in his depression right now that he cannot see a way out so hes pushing me away to because me less hurt, but its actually hurting me way more to know hes thinking about leaving me. I am sorry for all of the text but I just wanted to get some advice from outsiders. Obviously there is more to it than this but I do not want to write a whole novel hahah.

We have been together for over 3 years now and do not often argue/fall out. He has been struggling with (undiagnosed) depression for over a year now. Following this, he recently found out that a family member has been diagnosed with cancer, which he is understandably struggling with. We were also supposed to be moving in together within the next month but I can tell he is struggling from the pressure of finding a place. In the past two weeks, we took a 1 week break of not talking to each other to try and reflect on things. We both found this extremely difficult and are now suffering because of it. Yesterday, he told me he was considering breaking up with me during the break which was a huge shock to, also he has never said anything like this to me before. I just do not want to lose him and wish he could realise that breaking up is really not the right choice. He is not thinking straight right now and I just want to help him but I do not know how.Thanks so much in advance Need advice on helping my ldr partner through depression",Depression
8306,"I have been working from home since the pandemic began and still live with parents.Since then I have hardly left the house or seen friends and feel like both my mental and physical health have been impacted tremendously. I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home",Depression

I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here.

8309,"Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with ""What are you going to do?"". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like ""Oh I just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""Oh gee I do not owe you anything""Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected ""If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted. Shit my own parents made fun of me.I am tired of pretending I am comfortable I am not. I have no zeal none at all to live. Tired of being belittled constantly.",Suicidal

I do not have internet and I will not even have the phone I am typing this on soon.Does anyone have any recommendations that will actually help me other than just telling me to keep going?I am really getting sick of being at such a low point and truly think of non-existence as being so much better.I have no friends and no family.

8321,"Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself",Suicidal

I got put on venlafaxine at the end of June and have been titrating up since. My mood has increased a noticeable amount and, while I still feel depressed, I think things are finally looking up. But for some reason it feels as though I do not want that, or as if I should still be so deeply depressed that I want to die. Has anyone else experienced this? what is the deal?

I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many sub-categories to what is adding to my mental health crisis, but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired.

8342,"I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR; my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much, and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing, like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment, the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with, I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, I promise, I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also, also, I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them, majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication, but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways, I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it (long story)",Depression

Most of my friends I have kept joined the military long term so I only communicate every once in a while through text or call. I met a girl almost a year ago who had so many common interests it was crazy. Even the mental health problems. We used to work together, but I recently got a new job. We saw eachother almost every day, and talked EVERY single day, without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year, and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years, and she has been much help with my journey. But at times, I would start arguments with her over minuscule things, that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years, and stupid me started drinking (I am not an alcoholic, I just needed something to clear my head) She asked for space, but I kept texting her, I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me, and that I was going to go to her house. (I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated, and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like, I just looked for any outlet of attention). At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done, no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person, but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable, and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things, but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on, but I feel terrible.

I do not want to do anything, I do not feel like talking to anyone and I just wish I could just not exist anymore.

I finally got my butt back into therapy after struggling for the past three years and was diagnosed with severe depression (no surprise I just think I did not want to hear it).

While I still do not feel better I feel more hopeful and I am grateful. I have started to enjoy life again. I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness: - I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. - I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety, it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. - I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. - I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100% happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have.

But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself.

8434,"Hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. I tend to be very apathetic, apart from when I am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby I engaged in to relieve boredom, which are video games. I have some suicidal ideation, because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. I have so far failed to mention my autism, which I inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression, although I do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. My heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression, shorter life spans and a greater chance of CVD, although I am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. I am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood, as my consultant thinks that I may have Bipolar and I am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is, if I even have it in the first place.(I am whole food starch based, but I understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind, as my oldest sister still likes them.)My main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety, possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending, much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. I am completely fine in the presence of others, like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings, but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure, knowing I have some time before I encounter them again. Quickly going back to nutrition, I think I might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium, which seem to have a role in mood, alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and I am also taking ashwaganda. My grandfather on my fathers side, the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life, thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. (He shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once, despite being very middle class.) I also have problems falling asleep at regular times, but no issue getting it consistently. I must further mention that I have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother, to the point where I very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father, who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.I grew up in a Christian community and also a completely secular sailing club, which gave me the feeling of being Jekyll and Hyde before having known about the book. But both feelings where equally enjoyable. Although I was in a Christian environment much more. This was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling I suppose, although one of my friends at church who I do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and I think he could have been autistic. I keep in sparse contact with one friend from my Christian-hood and none of the good friends I made in public school.And yet, after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes, such as aerobic fitness, what could be the because of my low mood? Any supplements you guys would recommend, as I am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.Thanks for reading this long post.

8443,"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them.Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden of having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to falsely hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal

I am never happy, I am always miserable, I am always fucking bored, I lost all my social skills, i have 5 friends, my family does not even like being around me, my coworkers all know I am fucking insane and keep a distance from me, I work at a gas station because I feel too incompetent to do anything else lol cannot get lower than that, I had a physique like a young Hollywood teen actor until I allowed my depression to destroy it, now I am skinny fat, I always feel like a useless piece of shit degenerate loser, I have only been laid by three girls and all three of them just wanted to fuck me for my body, I have suicidal ideation running through my brain all day long, hell I even almost died last year from a suicidal overdose on a bottle of lamictal but thankfully I survived it and got locked in a nuthouse for my 5th time in a three year span, when I am not at work I lay in bed on my phone all day long, joy ride, take walks, stress eat, or go to the gym, and when I am there I deal with crippling social and performance anxiety and can barely lift for an hour. I am emotionless, cold, have repulsive thoughts, existential dread, have destroyed any opportunity I have ever had placed in front of me, feel like an outcast, etc etc etc. I tell my psychiatrist that I do not want to take my meds anymore, he gets nasty with me and tells me that he will not wean me off of them and if I want to stop taking my meds I am on my own. I got discharged from my Intensive Outpatient Therapy Program for smoking weed and refusing Residential treatment. I am so fucking stuck and have no idea what the fuck I am still doing existing, I want to fucking die, but I do not want to kill myself because I am scared of the pain of dying and what it would do to my parents. I smoke a juul pod a day for the sole purpose of getting cancer and all I want to do right now is smoke weed and mask my pain. My life has felt like a curse and a nightmare from the start and I feel like I am incapable of turning it around, being loved or giving love.

I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt, she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor, he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option, we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family, no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this.

I realize now that the career I so loved is not going to work out for me.And it is too late to reasonably switch.I have been looking at the balcony recently more and more. There are people working outside so it would not be a good time to make the move now. What do I tell my family? My friends? Do I just say goodbye? Tell them how much I appreciated their love and kindness? There are days where I have felt good recently, but it is fleeting. I have literally failed badly in the prior weeks due to this depression in my residency, effectively closing the door on a subspecialty I think I would have enjoyed. Now I am stuck - likely not going to get a job in an area or in a hospital that I will remotely enjoy. After a decade and a half of my life, 12-14 hour days and intense, emotional stress. This is it.I supposed I should be grateful. I do have a loving family. A loving girlfriend. My best friend lives in Vancouver, he checks in from time to time. My sister recently visited and it was very nice seeing her.I did a trial of therapy. She gave me breathing exercises and some CBT to help cope with these negative thoughts. However, at the end of the day, none of that is going to change the situation I am in. I could have had so much more. I will always think that in the back of my mind at work. I know this about myself. it is going to drive me crazy. I gave up so much to be where I am at today. I supposed this is a spoiled, comparative mindset that is truly unhealthy. I should be glad to be making a top income in the US. I have the ability to subspecialize and impact people's lives in a nice way. But I fucked up. Royally.This is not a goodbye.

8511,"Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs, one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could, i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed, my story was harsh, and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt, write and do digital art as a hobby, but lately that was not enough, i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself, about my relation with my family, with my friends, etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger, since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver, i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point, although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble, sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year, they did not fire me because even though all the fights, i was a good worker, and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract, and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays, so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting, i got on a fight with a close friend, and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a ""friend"", i took it at something they would go ""backsies"" later on. Trust issues, man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job, took my stuff and returned to my folks places, which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job, then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it, is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super corny/girly/nonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff, and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it, although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic, with it some commissions. I started saving money again, and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life, since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me, she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown, she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself, i tell her i feel miserable, wronged, sad, and still want to die. I want the pain to stop, I am more scared of keep hurting than of died, a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that, but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this, so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone, and even if a stop feeling hurt, that will not change easily. TLDR: random rant and followup to last post.

Even adderall was not able to help or clear my mind of this fog. I am really really afraid, because this time I will not be able to fight it or to wait for it to clear. I just need hope, i want to go back,not everyting was perfect before, but this complete ego death, no self worth, weakness, brain fog is just unbearable. Also, I am still using my meds as I was in the depressed state: zoloft, adderall(very low dose) and quetiapine(also low) Please tell me it is not comming back",Depression
8513,Soo umm i am a 15 year old studying in 11th (I know its pretty young) and was wondering what to do..I actually am pretty confused what to do I am not afraid to die but even if i die someday i wish it to be quick. After surfing through internet and much more I came to a realization that only studies matter in this world..If you cannot study your life can never be secure and you will face hardships. The constant nagging from parents to study and them always pointing out faults criticising us...(My parents are actually good it is just that on studies things happen.. they do not beat me but those petty fights and unknowingly pressurising me)I many a times get lecture from them about how important is future and why i need to work hard for the upcoming years. The fact is that i know it pretty well but i cannot find the motivation in doing it.. I love my family a lot it is just that( I am sorry its very complicated to explain) I do not even know why i am writing this post. I am just unsure what to do I do not want to commit suicide or anything as i know it will devastate the family and i also have a little brother whose life i do not want to ruin by dying I change topics very quickly as you can see by reading this post Its just like i do not know my true feelings..my true selfI am not able to concentrate right now and just umm never mindmy mind is going wobble Uncertain About Life,Suicidal
8514,"So many people post here. you are lucky if you get more than one comment. A lot of the time people just upvote and do not even say anything and that is if your post is popular. Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong, I usually am. I just know that every time I come here, because I want to be with people that get it, I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone. But it honestly never helps me. Yet I come back. Either to leave a comment, to reach out to someone I relate to, or to a make a post that I delete immediately. All of which pretty much leads to more nothing. More loneliness. So yeah I just had to say that. And obviously none of you guys will even see this. But I hope that whoever does has an okay day. I am still trying to learn to celebrate the ok days, myself. Because those are my new good days now. I do not have good days anymore, but that is okay. I am trying to get by without doing anything to hurt myself or the people around me. If I manage to do that, then my day was okay and that is good. Too bad, when it rarely happens, its still never enough. But at least its better than the bad days. Posting here to try to feel better is almost as futile as living.",Suicidal

8518,"there is a plethora of ways I could kill myself at this moment, many of which would be pretty painless. Or at least, I would not be in the right mind to feel the pain if I were to commit.But I cannot do it.Is it fear? Is it that I still want to live? Nothing actually seems particularly wrong with my life, so is it just a phase? Am I trying to be edgy? I do not know. I am not even focusing on what the title of the post says, I just wanted to write something.Also just realized that I might have imposter syndrome, which is fun.I feel like I am just fucking things up for myself despite having everything I need around me. I feel like I do not deserve to contemplate suicide because other people have gone through actual, real pain. I am at a time where I should be finding focus, where I should be giving it my all, but everything I have done up until this point feels pointless and I feel I will never achieve what I want even if I tried now. I hate myself making things so much harder than it needs to be. And I hate myself for not even trying to make it better for myself. Can this even be called being suicidal? I do not know. I might be overreacting. But at the same time I want to die. I do not want to turn 18. But I am turning 18 soon and I do not know if I want to just end it before I have to face becoming an adult or if I should try to survive by then because I know that there is still a chance to improve. This is just a full on rant, no one's going to read this. I want to talk to someone, but I do not know if I can trust them. I am afraid to find out what would happen if people knew that I have these thoughts. Would my friends and family still love me? Would they see me differently? Where do we go when we die? Do we get reborn when we die? If I were to die, would ""I"" ever feel the sensation of having control over body and thought again? Is it worth finding out? Should I try now? Or would it just be endless nothingness forever for me? it is fucking cold. I have a hoodie on, but my body feels like there is chills all over it. I do not know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life buried in textbooks and nothing else and now I am crumbling under the expectation that I have to apply for uni, whether they will even accept me, why I did not do anything in the past few fucking months I had to do something about this worry. I am scared I am going to disappoint everyone, because I know I made them all believe in me. But now I feel like I am going to betray them by either fucking things up for myself or just ending it all. I do not want to sleep, and I do not want to wake up. I do not want to fail, but I just want to end it all. Who decided that life had to be this confusing? Who decided to give me this fucking brain that thinks these thoughts? I am scared to find out if I would actually kill myself before my birthday. it is only a little bit away. I do not want to put that burden on my family. I know that they love me. I love them. I am fortunate enough to have them around when I cry, so I do not know why I am even having these thoughts. I do not deserve to be like this. I wish I spent my time doing at least something else. Maybe then I would have a better idea of what life is about. Of whether or not my worries are even important. Whether I deserve to cry.This was a long rant. I doubt that one can even form a reply to this. I just wish I could pick something and stick to it - either try and give it my all or decide to end it all now.

I waste my life knowing I waste it and I will not get this dream life I thought my life was going to be like the first 26 years I spent on this life.I am currently 27, about to hit 28 and I found out last September right before I was going to turn 27 that I had a mild autism. 5 years prior to that I got epilepsy and I have been isolated from severe social anxiety and depression since 2011, which is the year I was diagnosed with ADD. While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature. But that I was going to at least satisfy my interest in cars by driving them, have me &amp; my friends journey life together, go to parties, live my teens like a teen, have girlfriends, have a job and not have anything stand in my way apart from a bit of a bump in my speech. But that was not the case. At all. I have always been this very mute, socially awkward guy everybody is scared of. Until they talk to me and find out I am not that bad. But with my inability to read so much socially I have to rely on others to start the conversation.This autism answers many questions. There are a lot of things I do not understand with this world when it comes to the social stuff. it is just so damn frustrating, because even if I want to be social and have friends I just do not fucking know how to do it. I am so out of touch with so much on the internet despite fucking being isolated on it for 10 fucking years. Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels, music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstream/casual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything ""internet""/meme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside, so lacking in everything. And in these 10 years I have made so much progress outside with my social anxiety but I keep failing and making it the other way when it comes to online. Multiplayer games are pretty much impossible.

All I would have to do in the past is wait for the depressive period to pass but now I just feel so out if it. I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none, it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music, video games, social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine.

I eat mostly well. I have friends. I am in decent overall health. I have got a stable life. I have got an objectively great job, some family, a few good friends, finances are okay, can afford to buy and do things I want.

Either they are too far gone or its just not in the cards for them?I do not want to admit that about myself, but I cannot ignore brazen fact. I just do not think I am cut out for life. And the ONLY thing, and I do mean **ONLY** thing, keeping me from taking my life is the pain I would feel during it. Everything else I have already come to grips with. Making mom sad? Leaving my cats? Making a mess for the police to clean up? Etc. I have accepted all of that. I just literally cannot do this.

I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant.

Well, this therapist is new to me, but before I came to her I was looking into short term disability. And before, I thought that maybe I could just tough it out. I am one to kind of push on through. I think that because of my flair for the dramatics, I do tend to downplay and gaslight the fuck out of myself when I am depressed. When I lost a job opportunity it got bad. I relapsed and started SH again. Which is something I do not like about myself. I was clean for about three months, but lately my job has been really hard on me. We started with 50 workers in my position, there are now 8 left....only 7 months later. I have even gone as far as nearly getting into an accident as a passenger, and being disappointed I came out unscathed. I wished something would happen. I do not enjoy weekends because I know I am going back. And the people I speak with are lovely, but I am incapable of thinking straight and you know when you are just getting BAD again. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. My therapist said I would qualify, I have to talk to my pcp about it, but I feel so guilty. Everytime I get on the phone to talk to someone about it, I burst into tears. it is so humiliating to know they have got me crying for an hour recorded begging them to just ""Bear with me, I never do this. I am so sorry, I do not know why I am crying!"" I just need help. How did you get the STD approved? What should I expect? Please, please, no negativity. Taking a leave at 23, when I am otherwise in good health, is truthfully so humiliating and saddening. I feel bad enough. Claiming Short Term Disability for work. TW - SH, suicidal ideation",Depression
8606,"My GF suffers from bad depression. She had become very distant and to me it felt like she was pushing me away. She started a new job and went really quiet. I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space, but idk why she would of thought that. She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore, I could not do it any longer. I was very patient with her and would let her initiate any plans to hang out My GF was moving through a bad time of depression",Depression

8610,"I have had chronic ideations my whole life so this is nothing new but I thought Id finally gotten to a financial place where I could find someone to talk to. My husband gets annoyed when I ask for help, I work from home, we only have 1 car and all my friends/people who give a single shit about me are hours and hours away. Bit isolated. I am tired. there is no out. There will never be. I cannot keep asking my friends to listen to me complain about the same shit over and over, they have their own shit that is more important. I do not want to work 2 jobs and do all the cooking and housework but that is just my life. Husband has a spending problem so I am looking to pick up a third job after he quits his (I support this, he was a kind man until he started this job) so I do not have to go back to noodles once a day as sustenance and selling anything of any value. Although I do not think I own anything that cost more than $50 at this point. Maybe job 3 will be what does me in. Girl can hope. I am sorry, Ill probably get rid of this soon, its not like I can be helped. that small hit in my finances did a lot of damage and I have no one I can talk to so I hoped getting it out, even just somewhere would relieve a little bit of the tension in my brain. Was so close to being able to go to a therapist",Suicidal

8612,"As the title says I am feeling so lost, it happens every so often maybe every few months or so. Like I just loose all motivation and it feels like I am in a state of trance and I just cannot bring myself out of it. I cannot feel joy and gets overwhelmed with the feeling of boredom. I starts to cry randomly even if I do not think of anything. it is just the worst feeling in the world to me. No doubt anyone will read this and that is fine it was just me thinking out loud and kind of hoping it would make more sense if I write it down, maybe help pull myself out of it or something. It did not really so I will just drink and wait it out I guess. Feeling so Lost",Depression
8613,"My family has such high expectations. They expect me to work three minimum wage jobs because that is what ""adults do"". I did not ask to be born. I did not ask to grow up in this world where I basically have to work in order to survive. I have one job. it is not like I am a bum but whenever I am not a work, it is a problem. Whenever I have free time, it is a problem because to them I could be doing something better in my free time. I always get compared to others. I always get told I am not normal and that I am weird for just staying home and relaxing on my days off instead of picking up more jobs. I work 40 hours. What the hell do they expect? If this is adulting, I do not want any part of it. it is bad enough I am depressed and find it hard to get out of bed.

8615,"it is been years I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, Ocd and what not but everytime I have some big fight with my parents i feel its the breaking point and I am surely going to attempt to kill myself again. They have issue with everything I do, how I behave, how I look. I try my best but in their eyes I am nothing but a disappointment and failure which should not have existed in the first place. Yes they have said it to my face especially my mom. She is dealing with her own health issues because of which she tends to breakdown as well but there is a limit to talking shit about your kid. I never mentioned any of my relationships to my mother but she was very open about it so I mentioned about the girl I like now and she straight up demotivated me to the ground by saying I am not good enough for her, I am unattractive and what not, and honestly at this point if someone hands me a cyanide pill I would happily take it and end it once for all. I already hate myself and her talking shit to me just makes it worse more and more because I loved her the most in the entire world. Just because I am not capable of showing or expressing it does not mean I take her for granted. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up or OD on some sleeping pills and painkillers I hate myself and everyone around me",Suicidal

I completed two back to back phone interviews with the owner and manager, then boy the next thing i know we are talking about start dates and pay and...I am terrified? I should be thrilled. How lucky am I that this happened? I should be jumping for joy because I desperately need a job, have not worked in a year due to covid, and this could be a great fit for me. But all i keep coming back to is how much I want to die. How anxious at failing i am. How depressed i am. How incapable I am. How I have walked this road before; gotten a cool job, dealt with the stress for a few days, and then broke under the weight of constant suicidal ideation. Its a pattern I, and the others in my life recognize. To the point that everyone I tell when getting the news mentions that ""oh well I am sure you can handle it this time"" This time...But I am so afraid. I am so depressed.

8618,"I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot. He says he feels the same, but he does not show it. Were both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship. He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other (5 or 6 times within 3 months), why he takes hours to answer messages while always online, why he is not more involved in the relationship. He was not like that at the beginning, and I am not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not. I have been having difficulties trusting people (because of one past relationship) and I am not sure I believe him 100%, although I really want to. I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious. How can I support him, especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he cannot give me the relationship I want? He says he cannot offer me consistency, that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next. I have no idea what to do and how to do it. Helping my depressed date",Depression

I used heroin for 20 days straight (no longer using) to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days, and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged.

My mother loves Hana and she is probably the only one Hana loves that much. Idk what Hana would do. My mother is nearing 50 idk how she is supposed to live alone. Fuck this.

I am not accident yet but i have been through a lot of shit and all the trauma has rendered me useless. i feel pathetic and i had my fair share of near death experiences in the past but i think i want to try again, i consider it everyday but some days it is way more desirable. I am sure no one would care. my life is falling apart and i have no one to trust through anything so what is the point. people generally dislike me because i am socially inept (i do not try to be rude and i do not think i am but i have a hard time communicating with people because of anxiety), and I am ugly. there are too many things i wish i could do but i cannot because i have limited resources and energy for that matter. yet at the same time i have no real goal in life anymore. i think i did at one point but the more i go through the less i care. i have intense paranoia because my parents in the past have invaded my privacy alot so i only have reddit. the paranoia is killing me and i feel like i cannot do anything without precautions. i could keep going for ages about the pathetic state of my life but there is always going to be something is that are unsaid so there is no point. idk. i just want to start planning again on ending it all because nothing is working. feeling gross and miserable, cannot think of a better title.",Suicidal

8623,"Hello everyone,I am considering starting psychotherapy (again). I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically, even if there is nothing going on, I feel constant anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money). This also causes my anxiety. &amp;#x200B;I appreciate any thought, idea, and help. Thank you :) How can I overcome my feelings of anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain?",Depression

Forget about being a quality human being, there never was such a thing. People need to start doing negative actions in order to rectify all the wrongs going on.

In order to change anything, be a nasty person and take what you can, because that is how happy people live.

The former option was checked on her checklist but not the latter option. She saw what I see but she did not understand, but instead she used it to increase her pride or ego, told people without my consent, I honestly believed (and it should be) that if there is anything private, you should be honored that you out of all people are the one they tell it to so you do not say it and also take pride on it that way friendship is formed, tell to my father, whom I hate for reasons I am not telling, and tell to everyone who is not at all understanding.

I was not asking for it, I did not care what food was purchased. I felt manipulated but also was in the middle of work an it did not seem like the time to pry. I do not want to stop him from being happy either. It feels very manipulative to me. When he came back he was happy an ate and went back to sleep. He spent the rest of the evening on his phone till I went to sleep then ""had trouble sleeping"" and stayed up all night. This has become a cycle, apparently he only gets good sleep when I am awake. I keep thinking he is going to leave since last fall. Everyday I am prepared for him to tell me how he does not love me, that he never did.

It really sucks cus I feel like I cannot truly appreciate the time I have with others. I have been suffering for a long time. I have honestly given up at this point, and the only reason I still try to push myself and progress is for other people. I know I need to love myself and treat myself better, I am trying, really.

I only ever talk to 4 people, which I do not have a problem with at all, but despite having these people in my life, I feel so alone in this world.

8652,"I am an extremely introverted homosexual boy of 18 living in an extremely homophobic, judgemental society where gays are subjected to be killed if they ever come out, so I basically have no future other than living a lie in fear, hiding my feelings forever and never getting to love in my entire life. I used to be a very bright student who scored all A grades during my secondary education but ever since I started my high school, my grades have been drastically dropping because I am depressed all the time. I come from a big family with a history of bright minds and all my cousins, siblings and peers are all extremely well performing, meanwhile I am being a disgrace to my family. The pressure on me is immeasurable. I basically have no other talents, I have a weak, skinny body and I am not at all good at any sports either. In my attempts to search for something I am good at and as an attempt to hide my sexuality, I started going for basket-ball practice with some boys (because I found the game compelling), but only felt a burden to them and the only one who did not show any improvement in months, so I quit it. I do not even know what my career would be and what to try for even if I considered to live an unmarried life (which is again risky because I will be constantly judged). My social life is also non existent because I have just 2-3 friends who I talk to, and not one of them is close enough for me to share any of these with. I tend to distant everyone because I fear they will know my truth. I am also very insecure about my looks and my body so I have ceased to go out whatsoever unless necessary. I was also bullied back then at my hometown for having a feminine attitude until I got extremely sick and my family had to move to the city for better treatment for me, and ever since I have refused to return to my hometown even for a vacation. That said, I am also a sick person with a weak immune system and my family pays too much for my health care, for my studies etc and I do not think any of it is worth it. I also recently did a huge mistake, which is dating a girl who confessed to me, as an opportunity to change/hide my sexuality or in case someone is suspecting I was gay, only to hurt her due to lack of affection from me. I could not bear hurting her anymore so I broke up with her, but could not give a good reason for it, and it turns out she still loves me to this day and is constantly getting hurt. My siblings, parents have no idea what I am going through and often mocks me and jokingly comments on how I am good for nothing, not like other boys, ugly, etc. So I often avoid interacting with them either and isolate myself in the room for most of the time of the day. In short I am an ugly good-for-nothing living a lie in fear with no future yet with a lot of pressure on me. Thanks for reading. I did not have anyone to share this with",Depression
8653,"The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall. ~ Marcus AureliusHow many of us, do I wonder, have felt the physical thrill of playful fighting with another as a child? Testing your strength against your father, perhaps your mother, as a child? Or play fighting with friends using sticks as magnificent swords of truthiness, and imagining the jungle gyms as your castles?As a child we all desire to be someone magnificent, no? Someone grand, who can fight the monsters and demons life throws at us, and be a beacon of hope and love for our fellows. Or mayhaps that might just be me?Because, as a child, there comes a time when we realize we are not so magnificent, we are not so powerful and full of divine strength and wisdom. We as children are faced with many moments where we are utterly helpless, and must rely on the love and kindness of others to get us through the day. I would say that we are children still, and always will be, until death teaches us our last lesson. I have come to realize that not one of the so called ""adults"" that surround me, truly know what they are doing. And I say that in a sense of, what they are doing with life, more so than what they are doing in their field of work or with their hobbies. I say that we are all still children, struggling our way through something that no one knows about, for what truly is life? What truly is the reason we have come into being?Have you ever had a child ask you question after question? Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green? Why do I breathe? Why do I eat? Why am I alive? Why? Why? Why? it is like they are wrestling your mind this time, instead of testing their strength against yours. I worked, for a time, in a children's rehabilitation center for those who had been sexually assaulted, had sexually assaulted others, were addicted to drugs, had anger issues and have murdered. Children. Some were adolescents, some were only 12 in age and had been passed through the system because their mothers and fathers could care less about them. Why does not my mother love me, I heard once. I had not an answer. I did not know who this child's mother was because she never bothered to come visit. All I knew was that she had issues of her own, nothing excusable mind you. The child clung to me because I had answered so many of their questions before, but I had no answer then. It was only days later he was begging me not to let the police take him away. It broke me, because I did not have an answer then either. I digress, I live in a past moment. I state this because these children were wrestling their demons, but no one had taught them how too. No one had cared enough, it seemed to me, because no one wanted to, or truly knew how to, handle them. Granted there were maybe two others besides myself that wanted to do their best for the children, but its easy to burn out against a system that only cares about the money these troubled youths bring them. I do not ignore their transgressions, never that. But these were children. They were wrestling against traumas no one bothered to show them how to handle. They were mimicking the so called ""adults"" in their life they were told to trust. They were doing what was done to them. It made me truly understand that every other human being might be wrestling against their own demons, and with no one in their corner, how can one expect them to face the hundreds of opponents and circumstances that life always throws at us?Do you wrestle without knowing how to wrestle? Yes, that is how you learn. Is it easier when someone that you can trust helps you, teaches you, and shows you how to wrestle? Yes. What I am saying is there are a thousand, thousand ways to fight something. You learn alot of that on your own, and you may not know there is a better way to do it, until someone comes along and bothers to show you.My final point, is, as Marcus Aurelius states, humans, animals, organisms, will wrestle with many things in their attempt at life. Or in other terms, to live is to struggle. Knowing that, should we not all attempt to make it easier on others? Knowing that you yourself have been through many matches where you were outnumbered, with no one in your corner, can you truly blame yourself for just trying? For when the bell tolls, it signals your match is at its end. So Live. Struggle and survive. Wrestle, fight, war against life. Do not fall , stand tall and rage, rage against the machine.And stop being so damn hard on yourself For whom the Bell tolls, the wrestler, the pacifist, the young and the old, the struggling, the peaceful, the villain and the bold.",Suicidal

I know that I am rather introverted and quiet but that is because growing up my mother always yelled at me and I do not like yelling and being loud it makes me super uncomfortable. Everyone always thinks that I am unhappy and not comfortable, maybe I am but how can one be truly happy if they have no goal they are striving towards or any internal motivation let alone true friends and family?

I want to just take a shitload of tylenol and hope that I am not the 60% of people who experience pain during liver failure.I promised my girlfriend that I would get her help. Shit, I got a panic attack brcause I could not get her an online meeting with a psychiatrist that could help her as soon as possible. I promised her she would be happy again soon. I promised her I would stay. I promised her that she would get better. But she is not. She is not getting better.I am the one making things worse, she cannot see it, but I am. The most recent argument left me devastated for no fucking reason whatsoever, apart from me realizing that its not something else that is the problem. Its not that we both have problems. Its meI am the problem.I want her to be happy and find someone better than me. Someone that will not use manipulative tactics without realising. Someone who will be able to trust her again easily even after breaking my trust once. But I broke hers ""for the better"" and that ended in a dumpster fire. All I leave behind is chaos. The bad kind of chaos. I need to pull out the weed from the flower patch by the root, so it will not grow again. I dom't want her to come with me. I want her to find someone better than me after I am gone (if I find the courage to take more than two pills of tylenol) and live those dreams we had with a proper man that will take care of her and can take care of her. I am sorry Margarita. I am sorry that I have done all of this to you. I love you.

8687,"I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends, I have no motivation for anything, no future. The only thing I still care about and have still been hanging on for is my parents. I have been thinking about suicide for a while but they are the only reason I have not gone through with it yet. Yesterday was just like any normal day, everything was fine. I had just picked up the movie Spiral and was wanting to watch it with my dad the next night since we were both big saw fans. I went to sleep and the next thing I know my family was waking me up saying he had a heart attack while on a walk with the dog. We rushed to the hospital, where they told us they could not bring him back and he was gone. It felt like such a surreal moment, like none of it was even real. I saw his body and cried so fucking much, but it is like it has not fully sunken in yet. It probably will though soon. And when it does.. I think I am finally going to do it. For the past several years I have been struggling with bad dpdr and depression, and because of it I have been avoidant of a lot of stuff. I have gone out less and less, talked to people less, even going out places with my family. Anytime they would go somewhere and asked me to come I would say no and just stay home. I wish I could take back all those times. Wish I would have not been such a lazy piece of shit and actually made the effort to get better and spend time with them. If I had actually said something, or went to a doctor about it, and not waste my life by sitting around doing nothing, avoiding it and avoiding them. Wish I would have done more with him. Wish I would have done more with all my family. A couple weeks ago I told him a bit about some of my problems, and I promised him I would start going out more and try to get better. He was one of the only things left I still cared about and lived for, and now that he is gone.. I do not think I have the strength to keep going. I am sorry to everyone. Sorry to my dad. Sorry to my family. Sorry to everyone I was ever an asshole to. I wish I could go back 10 years and just have a do over on everything. My dad just died and I think I am going to kill myself",Suicidal

I do not want to give too much detail, but they do little things that make me feel like they really do not give a crap about my anxiety. Like how I hate taking pictures, especially with other people, because I feel self-conscious and literally feel like the ugliest person alive. I told them about it and they apparently understood. Then a few days later they force me (Literally pull me by the arm) to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal, but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act, they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because, I mean, it is just a picture, right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course, this is not the only thing I am dealing with. I really hope I am not the only one that is going through this, but I do not feel human anymore. It feels like my mind has detached from my body. I do not feel present. It feels like I am floating and like I am not alive. Idk how to explain this, but it gets even worse during stressful situations. I do not know what I want anymore.

All my live I kind of strolled through it with no resistance. I was happy. I never had trouble with anything. But once I entered university that gradually changed. Suddenly things became hard, people had expectations of me. I have to know what is to come months in advance and prepare for it.I feel fake. I do not have the passion for foresty my other classmates had. I only chose this major because I kind of liked biology class in highschool. But I never had a passion for it. In highschool I could just stroll along and do fine, but that just does not work anymore. Everyone wants me to know what I want. I do not know what I want! Or its more like I do know what I want I just want an easy life. An easy job. I wish I joined a college instead or maybe some kind of trade school, maybe I could have learned carpentry or plumbing or how to fell trees. Id be happy just working under a boss, 9 to 5, just do as I am told. I could have had my own home by now if I did that. Id be able to come home after work and do something else. Play some games, watch TV, maybe get into a new hobby like reading or writing, maybe try dating. I cannot do any of that in college. I am constantly anxious and overwhelmed and I cannot pay attention and I do not know what to do and I fear that all jobs in this field will be equally stressful and exhausting.Despite the trouble I described I largely made it through all my classes. I actually only have 1 test that I need to resit. But I do not want to do it anymore. I wish they never put the idea in my head that I am smart. I do not feel smart. I feel like an idiot that cannot handle the real world. I am so exhausted from looking for internships. I am so tired from having to do a large project each semester along with having to learn for multiple huge tests.I cannot quit university now. That would kill my mother, she is so worried about it. I can feel it in everything she does. So that is what I want to do. I want to at least finish university, and then I will see what I do.I wish I could do my entire life over again knowing what I know now. Id do it all so differently. Id spend more time being active, going outside, moving, learning new things, learning how to deal with adversity, Id find something I am passionate for or at least something I could enjoy doing as a peaceful job.I hope this rant is not against the rules or anything. I read them and it seems fine. Writing down my emotions and regrets like this makes it easier for me to process my emotions.

I never thought of this before, but I wonder what the consensus is: Can everyone ""get better""? If someone is struggling with deep-rooted issues that have grown over decades, can they be fixed? What is the standard for ""getting better""? Is it living a normal life? Is it for bad cases just being able to function to a degree with permanent support from professionals and medication? Do some people just have to learn to cope with their issues for the rest of their lives?I saw a documentary on euthanasia for mental problems, two were relatively young girls with depression. They had indeed lost all energy and will to fight. I wonder - was there really nothing left for them? Can everyone ""be saved""? Are there cases that are just beyond help?",Depression

I have made my fair share of mistakes, and I am more than willing to admit it, but I feel absolutely destroyed because we both put so much love into the relationship.

8752,"I will try to keep my story short; but I am also venting.My partner has suffered from depression for most of her life. She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed, and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks, or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone, and mostly, she feels there is no hope, that she has been suffering like this for decades, and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed, stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating ""I do not want this anymore"" over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic, and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again, but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked, I get tired, I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding, I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her, and this situation is in my head all day every day, but selfish as it is, I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now, I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks, and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner, like she is ""withholding"" sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case, she still feels like that. The sex is a non-issue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing, I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this, because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree, so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another.

8766,"Apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one, tl;dr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. I am just having a bad night and found this reddit, so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice.&amp;#x200B;My mental health struggles started when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin as well as told I should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. However, after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act (From what I hear, a common complaint.) Unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so I have been dealing with that untreated for awhile: Honestly I am so used to it at this point that the symptoms I deal with (I have always described is as not being able to make my head silent.) are so ingrained as normal that I forgot about it for a long time.&amp;#x200B;Aside from that, I was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. However, things changed when I was ten. Without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened: The first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. It also left me with deep mental scars which I have been told is a form of PTSD. I still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks, even just riding does and as I am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world, especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. The second thing was molestation and rape, something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. It only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. My mother only found out a few years ago when I broke down about it - the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. This is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. Depression, suicide attempts when I was younger, self loathing, hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it.&amp;#x200B;To add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male, I felt like I could not even seek help for it for the longest time. The stigma is not as strong now ah days, though it does still exist, that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well, I am sure you get the picture. Despite this I have seen doctors, I have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight, been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one.&amp;#x200B;This brings me all the current day. Despite all these issues I met someone who loves me. We got married recently. I have been happier then I had been in years, in all honesty she is the only person I have left anymore. My family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. But now that I have someone who depends on me as much as I do them...my mental state is getting worse. &amp;#x200B;I still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. My self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because I cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. The more she tells me it is alright, the more she tells me I do not have the worry about it, the worse it gets. The majority of her family hates me because they think I am a lazy sack of shit. I try to talk to her about it but I end up just making her feel bad, like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. I feel like I am spiraling out of control, I feel like she would be better off without me. I just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. My mind is so twisted with what I think is happening and what is actually happening, I almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. I thought for awhile I was getting better but now I feel more afraid and alone then I ever have before and I am doing it entirely to myself and I do not know how to stop it.My life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point, this one little miracle happened to me and I am going to absolute shit over it. I need help. I need advice I need something. I am terrified to lose her. I am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. I just do not want to be alone anymore yet I feel like I am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.So if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. Sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tl;dr PTSD, life long depression, ADHD, all relatively untreated. Managed to fall in love and get married. Was happier.

8781,"Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail, you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens, but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts, shortness of breath, and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was (talking, cuddling, kissing, or having sex), but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her (and have nothing go on between us) made me sick to my stomach, and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means, in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute (when the nausea happened i would step out of the room/car and walk around taking deep breaths) and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time, though. sometimes it was a little, other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now, after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that. I get this problem with other things too, like eating and going on vacation, as well as being deathly scared of smoking and drinking, but this particular situation is where it gets the most intense and the most frequent. I am on Prozac for my anxiety, if that is any additional information that may help. this whole thing has spiraled me into a deep pit of self consciousness and even self hatred. I have had countless nights just lying awake thinking about what is wrong with me and why i cannot justenjoy life the way i want without having to be controlled by the way my stomach decides to act one day.

Maybe I am just misremembering, or overthinking it because we have been friends for over a year now, maybe even two but I thought he was just telling me: Id rather be hanging out with her but you will do. I thought I could get over it, because I immediately just shrunk into myself when he said it but I cannot. Its a confirmation of every single fear I have ever had, every time I have ever felt alone, every time I have ever felt like dying. Now, every time I talk to someone, I wonder: Am I just an option to them? Do they even like me? Would they even care if I was gone? I just, cannot! I cannot get it out of my fucking head. I have not had a dark thought in weeks, and for the first time in a long time I was happy with my life. And now it feels like all of my fears and assumptions and doubts were true. My rational side is saying I am just overthinking it, we have been friends for a long time. It was just conversation, and a miscommunication at worst.

8791,"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them. Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden f having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal

8810,"Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career, just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to, or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there (medicine). I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like, I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore, but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything, and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest. Just want to write it out",Depression

I come to find out that he has been cheating on me and using me while I was trying to help him get back on his feet. I asked him about it and he blocked me. Two years of my life wasted. Funny thing was, if I had not met him I would be dead already. The last time I flew to see him, he ghosted me. I cannot anymore",Suicidal
8813,I was looking at some past friends social media and it made me realize even more how sad and pathetic my life really is. And yes before anyone says it I know social media is not real and only shows people the good sides and blah blah blah but still its clear these people are at least doing something in there life and trying to go after their dreams while I am just laying in bed..doing absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. Also I have no friends. I still really do not know why I have absolutely no friends like there are people who are absolutely shit and have tons of friends but I do not. At this point after this many years I have come to the conclusion I am just unlikeable for some reason. And I SWEAR to fucking GODDDD if someone tries to give me some advice on how to make friends. Trust me when I say I have done everything you possibly could to make friends. At this point I have given up and have decided to be friendless forever. Even if somehow someone all of a sudden wanted to be friends with me Id turn them down because Id be too pissed off that for some reason now that I do not give a shit about being alone now someone is trying to befriend me Id be mad.

8815,"I grew up on a farm where I saw a lot of brutal animal death at a young age and on top of all this I witnessed my parents marriage and sanity almost dissolve. Thankfully they are still together but the beginning days of the dairy farm really gave me a wakeup call that my parents did not know everything and were not the best decision-makers. I am now 25, battling intrusive thought OCD for 7 years and often extremely depressed. I try not to show it but I really want to die most days. I am kind of known as the funny guy by those around me but that is all just ""put on"" when in social settings. I feel obligated to not plan such a thing as my own suicide, because I do care about my parents and siblings, but in regards to life itself, I just wonder what is the point?I do not necessarily believe in a heaven or higher purpose, and I despair at the fact that so much unchangeable pain and death has already happened. My ""friends"" that I have always seem to surprise me with their lack of empathy about certain things and joking attitude about things as painful and saddening as suicide. They do not know that its something that is always on my mind, but their jokes about suicide still hurt because it is a serious subject. I feel so incredibly trapped by life and so in pain by intrusive thoughts. I seriously cannot tell anymore where intrusive thoughts end and where my conscious choices and ideas begin. I am a visual person that is always seeing bad imagery in my mind of things I do not want, and its so persistent that I do not always know if its me. At this point, if someone asked me if I am a good or bad person, I would say ""Yeah, I am bad"", despite the fact that I have never actually ""done"" something to anyone. I do not tell anyone this but I often wish I had never been born at all when my mind is racked with guilt and confusion. I do not think I am mentally ill, but there have been some moments in my teenage years when I did start to slip down the path of total confusion, such as a time in which I thought I may be the same person as my father. Yeah, it sounds stupid, but I thought since we did have a lot in common and he did look a lot like me at my age, maybe we were actually the same person. I often just feel that I am not in control of the types of thoughts I have and I feel at a loss for words about the kind of aimless person I am now.But honestly one of the biggest things that bursts any desire to further myself for a better life, is the hopeless of isolation. I have yet to forge an actual close friendship in the past 10 years or more. This is excluding my siblings and parents. Something where both people understand and are open with each other. Yeah, I can spout to one of my ""friends"" some philosophical commentary on life, but that is just surface level crap. I have never dated and do not know if I have it in me. So a lonely life ahead sounds miserable too tbh.The stuff where I genuinely tell someone how I REALLY feel about my life, my pain, my hopelessness and my internal rage at myself never happens. I begin to tell them personal stuff because their seemingly trustful, but then I see that they really are not engaged, and they may not even be listening.Because I keep convincing myself not to commit suicide, I often instead find myself just saying ""I wish life was already over by now."" I mean, its going to happen one day. Why cannot it just hurry up already for me, since its always looming in the background like an inescapable punishment. I know I should not feel this way, and I am sorry for that, but as this reddit group already knows, this is one of the only places where some people can vent their frustration or share their pain in the hopes that improvement will come from fellow sufferers. I think I have some repressed anxiety from childhood that really comes out in despair.",Suicidal

8828,"One thing someone said to me after telling them some of the things I have been through is that I am actually one of the strongest people there is for getting through it and still being someone who spreads positivity. The thing is, I am not strong. Barley anyone knows everything that is happened to me or about the void its left in my heart. I keep it hidden. I am a goofy type of person, so I hide it with laughter. I try to make people laugh and do good things as a distraction. Doing these good things makes me feel better about myself for a short amount of time. Like I said though, I am not strong. I constantly let myself get triggered and start remembering the trauma. I get so anxious sometimes that its hard to hide, and I am so terrified of opening up about it to many of the people I care about because I am afraid of letting myself be vulnerable like that. I know its probably irrational, but I am afraid that if they know the full story, they will come to see me the way that I see myself as a result of it all. Yet on the contrary, whenever I get anxious and start having flashbacks and stuff, I want nothing more than to have someone to break down to and to be completely vulnerable with without having to worry about how it would change their perception of me. I wish I could just let it all out like a little kid, but that vulnerability terrifies me. It results in a vicious cycle that I am aware is completely self inflicted, I am like the author of my own misery. If I was actually all that strong, Id be able to talk about it in detail without tensing up and getting sweaty and anxious. If I was actually strong, Id be able to not worry about being vulnerable like that. The fact that I do not have that strength is part of what makes me loathe myself so much. Does anyone else relate to all of this? Are these signs of PTSD or depression, or is all of this normal for someone with trauma in their past? I cannot stop letting my past haunt me",Depression

I have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for the last 7 years, and, for awhile, it was helpful for me. We found a good cocktail of medicine that helped me feel normal, and helped me function with my day-to-day activities. But, around the end of May I noticed that my meds just were not as effective as they once were. I have to state that I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and PTSD since 2003. I have also been suffering from insomnia in varying degrees of severity since then as well. I cannot stress how absolutely miserable it is to want nothing more than to sleep and not be able to.So back to the 7/12. I had been visiting my family for awhile since I have been working from home for a year and half, and I did not want to be alone every single day. Plus, I missed our family dog dearly. So it was great to spend time with her. While I was home, I also got a dog for myself, just, the sweetest little thing. But low and behold, she was born with a genetic condition that requires she get a total hip replacement. that is going to be 8K after all is said and done. I do not have that kind of money. Not at all. Anyway, when I left to come back home to take care of things here, I left my dog behind because her surgery was scheduled back where my folks live and I did not want to stress her out with a lot of back and forth travel. When I left, I did not get an opportunity to say bye to our 15 year old family dog. I figured I was coming back for my dogs surgery in August, so Id see her then. And then I found out my family had to put her down on 7/12. That little dog meanteverything to me. I have been used and abused and discarded by people all my life. My family (not my nuclear family, but the rest), my friends, everyone. But that little critter loved me unconditionally. And now she is gone. And I did not get to say bye to her. Furthermore, my dog is slated for surgery on 8/12, one month to the day of the other dogs passing. And, while I am not superstitious, its still causing massive anxietyjust in case anything happens to her. When I got back home I found a new psychiatrist; Id changed insurance earlier this year. However, he does not accept insurance and its $500 a session. I researched psychiatrists in my area and hes highly recommended and rated. And I like him. However, the costyeahalso not helpful for my stress and anxiety. We also changed my anti-depressantwhich now costs me 400 bucks a month. Again, cannot afford any of this. My weekly therapy is $130. I earn a good amount of money but I happen to live in one of the most expensive areas in the US, so my income does not go too far. So I have just been panicking. I am in a ton of debt. I have been trying to do everything right to help better myself. But every time I start to make progress it gets derailed. I have gained about 90 pounds in the last year. And I cannot seem to lose it or change my dietary habits because its so hard for me to care when I feel so exhausted. My job sucks, I am paid 60% of what I should be earning in my field as an entry-level position (though I have been doing this for 7 years). I have started looking for other jobs but its just exacerbating my anxiety. Like, to the point where its crippling. I feel like I am barely holding it all together and that, at any moment, the dams going to burst and Ill just spiral. I do not know what to do anymore. Id love for all of this to just be over.

I cannot interact with people well enough to get a date in the first placeBad news: mostly bad news. The thoughts are still there and boy oh boy are they growing. So during a few meltdowns I have done a real bad thing where I just walk out and go as far away as possible, remembering plan A in the process. Now they have been nagging me to do it more outside of meltdowns - mall, grocery store, park; hell, we got in a car crash a few weeks ago (dw everyone is ok) and I thought to just start walking and hope no one notices. Literally the only thing that stopped me was the cops sowing up to assess the damage. Speaking of plan a, that is also been nagging more. Not much to elaborate there.Another thoughts been growing, the one that I have had it too good. Been noticing my appetites going down cuz I feel like I do not deserve whatever I am eating. More commonly with meltdowns Ill try to get rid of clothes, jewelry, phone, etc thinking only good kids get to have it. I hardly even want to go anywhere anymore cuz all the fun places are good kid things and I should not have that.

I feel uncomfortable sleeping with him (we both have our own beds) and I am in my mom's room since I am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. I told him, you are not a little boy, go sleep in your room. I was told my depression was quite high and I tend to overreact sometimes but I just cannot control how I feel. I started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. My grandma said why I am so against it and I told her ""He mocks my depression every single time. You think I will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression?"" that is when both my grandma and aunt said ""it is all in your head. Control your feelings. it is just a minor thing, no need to overreact""I KNOW I am OVERREACTING BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL. THEM SAYING ""ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD"" MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT they are DISMISSING MY DEPRESSION AS SOMETHING SMALL. I FEEL REALLY HURT. I KNOW I ACT CHILDISH BUT I JUST cannot CONTROL MY FEELINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE FOR ME TO COME OUT TO SAY ""I HAVE DEPRESSION"" but i regret I ever did. They do not take my depression well. I attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. Why did I ever decide to trust them??

I am trans and I know I will *never* be able to come out of the closet but when I think about it even if I could what would that change? I blocked a bunch of my friends recently and plan to go back but am worried that is ruined forever with some of them and am kind of resigned to it. I understand if they do not forgive me. I was upset by something one of them said, I was upset at myself. They just asked me kindly not to make a certain kind of comment and I had a meltdown. I wanted to hurt myself so bad but I just got out of a therapy session about not doing that and it stuck in my head. I did not but I am not proud of it. I do not feel any better or good about it at all. I felt like I still needed to do something rash hence the blocking. I was so happy before and in a split second, I have crumbled to this familiar bullshit. I got out of a cult recently that my family remains firmly in, hence the fear of them. I cannot cut ties with them though, I do not want to. they are not bad people. I know they will never stop loving me no matter what and a lot of them suffer from the same things as me, depression and suicidal tendencies, they have kept me alive this long. I do not want to die. God, I do not fucking care if I live or not. I just do not see any other options. I have been doing okay with just hurting myself and am trying to balance stopping that without falling into suicide attempts. I feel like I have got to reach a certain level of fucked up before anyone will or should bother to help me. I want to be as pathetic as possible because if I get better people will stop being so careful when I still need it as much as they can offer. My throat is incredibly swollen right now from an illness. My friends made me care. I did not want them to miss me, I love them. I do not care right now. I am angry at them because I cannot afford to be angry at myself anymore. I would not survive it. I can either be an unpleasant, maybe even *bad,* person or a dead man. I do not want to die, but I do not believe I have a solution and I really would not care if I dropped dead right now.

8863,"As I type all this out, I am certain that the final chapter to my story is coming to a close. I am so lost. So empty. So bewildered. I do not even know what I am feeling right now, let alone who I even am. I can barely formulate words to describe to you how mentally fucked I am. that is why it is taken me over 7 draft's and 4 month's to type this post out. I want to apologize in advance if I am all over the place here.I really miss being a kid. I was a charming fellow who oozed optimism. Everywhere I went, I radiated positivity. Perhaps you could mistake this for innocence? Regardless though, everything was so different then. The only thing that mattered to me was catching the latest episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Never in a million years would I have expected to grow up and be worth less than the ground beneath your feet. Here I am at 21 and I have become, nothing. I do not have a car, I just got a job (and I probably will not keep it for much longer), I have no one to love or appreciate me, the little amount of ""friend's"" I have are slowly pushing me out of their lives, my credit is fucked. The only thing I have is Music. But even still, it can only go so far. Drowning out my thoughts in tune is great and all but eventually, I will be brought back to reality and my little fantasy will vanish.It does not help that I still live with my emotionally abusive, narcissistic mother. what is worse is that, realistically, she is the only remaining person in my life and because of this, I am forced to love her. But loving her fucking hurts. It feel's as if I am walking on egg she will's when I am around her. She constantly gaslight's and manipulate the fuck out of me to the point where now she has complete control over my life and emotions. Not only is everything my fault but she convinces me that I have said thing's to her and I cannot recall me ever doing so. If I try to strike up a conversation, she pays little to no attention to what I am saying what so ever, and then scolds me for not talking to her. She always calls me inadequate and weak. Whenever I mention a promise she made to me, or something hurtful she is said to me in the past, she acts like she has no idea what I am referring to and say's, ""...that does not even sound like me. I would never say anything like that to you..."". Everything she says to me leaves me questioning my past and rationality. Maybe I am a weak, lesser-human ass pussy that overreacts and exaggerates? As fucked as it sounds, at times I wish she would just bawl her hands up into a fist and let out all her frustration and anger onto me. But she does not. So instead, I take a blade to my arm and ""brand"" words onto it.it is incredibly difficult for me to describe my emotion's. it is almost as if my brain is like the physical manifestation of White Noise. Most of the time I feel so dissociative, my entire being is on auto-pilot and I do not really ""snap out of it"" until I am in stressful situations. But by then, anxiety ensues and I start trembling. Like now for example.Suicide has been the hand tugging at my shirt for as long as I can remember, as far back as my youth. I even attempted twice this year, and unfortunately I am still here to tell the tale. I know a lot of people attempt because they want for their pain to end. For me, it is a bit different. My pain will not end. As long as my heart beat's, I will forever remain this way. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. These thought's will never stop. I will never not be depressed and miserable. it is been almost a decade since I have been this way, and it will never end. I have tried almost everything: therapy, meditation, religion, hotlines, support groups. Nothing. Next time, I want to ensure my method will work. I do not want to survive and end up in a vegetated state or losing half of my face or what have you. Last month, I watched as my childhood friend was buried 6 feet under. He shot himself. Well, I take that back. I did not attend the funeral. My mom guilt tripped me out of doing so. Imagine what kind of shit friend I am. Pathetic. No wonder everyone is pushing me away.I have no idea what to expect when I post all this but...it is really late. I am not making any sense right now. If you managed to read through this bible's worth of text and hear me rambling and being a bitch, thanks I guess. Maybe someone might give a fuck. I have a treat for you. it is the only gift I can give this world: half decent taste in music. Listen to ""A Different Age by Current Joys"", the whole album. it is been on repeat as I have typed out all this bullshit.

I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you.

8878,"So much shame inside my head. I was raised in a Christian household, I was raised with proper, well adjusted parents. No trauma, no abuse, no abandonment or lack. Up until high school I always had at least one best friend, literally I always had one person who would agree with me that I was their best friend. Wed play tag a recess or just walk around the playground and talk about random shit. I went to church every Sunday, went to the beach with family, got along great with my siblings, parents had no favorites and treated us all equally, I had a cat I adored though admittedly sometimes terrorized it, I had (have technically, still living in the same home) a huge backyard that I played in almost every day with my siblings, we had (again have technically) amazing neighborhood friends. I would wake up every day with legitimate joy and wonder, I was excited, even for school. I had the kind of childhood that probably makes most people on this sub seethe with envy. Those people would read my post with incredulity, how in the living fuck is this guy? Why does he belong here?? He could not possibly understand what we have been throughand I agree. I do not. I do not know what the fuck is wrong with me, yet somehow I am emotionally and psychologically stunted, I isolate myself from family, I lash out at others for the smallest things, I victimize myself quite a bit, I just have a genuine disdain for this life. I feel like I have so much to say and yet my brain is so foggy. Of course when I want to say something my brain locks up, but if I want to sleep and relax, suddenly World War III has erupted in my head. Not that anyone would pay attention anyway, I understand that I am just another faceless person on this sub, whining about the same shit over and over and over again, just like everybody else. I was never popular, never had much attention given to me outside of family (yeah I know I sound pretty spoiled, many people on this sub could not even get attention from their family). I guess my problem is that I am just soterribly average and normal in all kinds of ways, and very much not average in all the wrong ways, in very disgusting ways, if that makes any sense. I have all this disgusting and inhuman traits, and nothing good. I have nothing to offer, I just should not fucking be here. Why did the universe allow me to be conceptualized? Why did my biological parents, whoever they are (adopted), have to create me?? All I ever wanted to do was be a super empathetic, compassionate, loving, safe, kind, accepting, giving, and joyful person. I am none of those. I am quickly losing my ability to empathize with others because I hurt too much, I cannot extend compassionate or love because reality is too cold and harsh, I do not feel safe with myselfhow long until that happens with other people as well? I am not very kind, I am super grumpy and angry at life and everyone in it, I am becoming very unaccepting of others because I feel like the universe or god has rejected me, I am not joyful, that is just a big no, I cringe at happy and uppity people. The only silver lining here is that I am sort of giving, only because I hate myself so much that I want to serve others (albeit in small ways) and forget I exist, I want to be put last. At the same time though I hate that I am feeling so left outso I want to be heard and acknowledged, but I cannot get any acknowledgment or attention from who it matters most..I am a horrible person with sickening thoughts anyway, why should I get any sort of acknowledgment. I should not get to have friends, to have a girlfriend (have not had one ever lol), to have a family that cares about me, to have hopes or dreams, I am nothing, I am no one important or special. I am just a dirty rag, I am the one cracked egg, the defective product, I have no purpose or use other than to be thrown away and discarded. I am understanding this and accepting this more and moreHonestly I barely care at this point whether people care anymore. I do not carethats all that matters. I am trying to think of other things to say, but that is probably a sign that I should stop. I have said all I can say, I have said many things multiple times over. I am not unique, I am not special, I am not someone anyone wants to be friends with or someone to look up to, I have no special qualities, no good looks, no intelligence, no wit or ability to make others laugh, I do not make anyone feel special or noticed or important, I do not make anyone excited when I walk in the room, if anything I suck the life out of the room, everyone watches me from their peripheral view, analyzing me to see what I want or what I am going to do, eager to see me leave. I justdont get it. I serve zero purpose and have no function. When people on this sub or anywhere else try and give me to stay, what is the fucking reason? could not be because I will help humanity, could not be because I have some special to offer, could not be because I look good, or give people the giggles, or befriend others easily, or make people feel at ease and calm, important, heard, it could not be because of anything good is my damn point. What do you want me to just sit in the corner and merely exist for the sake of my family? What kind of fucking life is that? Clearly no one in this world needs me, so you cannot possibly imply that there is some greater goal for me to achieve, or people to meet, or grand adventure to go on. I cannot do fucking anything that this world needs me to do, I cannot be anything this worlds need me to be, so just let me fucking go. Unfortunately society will not help me in this endeavor, so I must undergo this task alone, via hanging of the self. It should be fun. I do not care about the pain or slow agony of suffocating anymore, if anything I look forward to it in a sick way. I know I do not matter and do not have any worth or use, so its for the best. I am a creepy weirdo anyway, so I am just imagining all the faces of the people who will feel at ease knowing there is one less potentially dangerous person in the world, and Ill be happy knowing I will not live long enough to be one of them. So thanks for everything I guess, reddit has been a huge life saveruntil it is not I guess lmao. But seriously you guys helped me get through a lot of shitty moments, helped me fall under the illusion that I was not alone and I actually had a tribe, like I had found my people. I know my people do not exist, or if they do they are incredibly fucked up and nasty, and I do not want any empathy or compassion from them, I do not want to be related to them in any way shape or form. So Ill choose to kill myself instead. I literally cannot wait. For those of you who are leaving with me, see you on the other side (if there actually is one). Hopefully its a much better place than this, and we can ride on the cloud tops laughing at all the suckers stuck down here thinking its worthwhile. that would be awesome haha.

8894,"So, I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis (when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days) but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately, and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends, and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend, who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others, so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family, but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety, I sometimes do not take jokes very well, especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members, they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or, in rare cases, until I start crying. A lot of times, their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of ""I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of."" and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love, as well as mental heath topics, when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental health-wise in like a year, and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger.

I know I will work tomorrow, but when I am done... maybe exercise (that is not a big deal to me, it is more of a habit now anyways), but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life, which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here, but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again, but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself (thank you green for helping, I admit that), but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before, and even then I was getting brain shocks from that, but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault, but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals. Now I am back to scratching that spot on my head, dreading tomorrow.it is not like I am stupid... in some sense. Got the degree (yup, psych), dropped out of grad school, got a real estate license and personal training cert basically on a whim (both expired because I hate the selling). So I start and give up rather easily. My dream is to become an author. I know, overdone, but I cannot help it, I enjoy making a world and spooky stories and that is what makes it a dream, to at least live off that. Whenever I get someone to read something, I feel like I am forcing them to give me compliments, so now I have not touched my laptop (except for paying bills) in almost a year. I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone, constantly beating myself up, and knowing that tomorrow, I will not be able to improve. I would appreciate some input, or something nice? Ha. I am sure if you are reading this, you have an idea of why I am writing this. But it is not healthy. I take 20mg fluoxetine, but I cannot feel it. When I went up 40mg I felt terrible, so that is was not good. Anyways, thank you for letting me get this out.

Just past traumas like screwing up my first semester for college or leaving some very close friends by resigning from a job to improve my grades in college. It hurts so bad and recently it has been worse than usual. I am really considering getting a prescription for antidepressants but I have heard that withdrawals are like 5x worse than the lowest low. I am taking psychology in college so I feel like I should have better control over my emotions but I am almost at my breaking point right now.I am in this depressive state where I just do not know what I am doing with my life and I have a need to compare myself to others worse off in some way just to make myself feel better which is an asshole thing to do, but it is hard to help it sometimes. what are some coping strategies that I could use to not feel like piss every moment I am awake?

I like art and music but I am painfully bad at both. I look forward to nothing. I am financially well off and feeling this way while being so privileged just makes me feel like such a waste of space. a waste of protons, brain waves, oxygen, food, water, money. I am a parasite. if I write a will stating that i need my money to go to several orgs and then off myself, would that work? Or should i send all of it off first? Idk how much longer i can wait.6 months ago I felt good and like i had grown from my first attempt. I have drive to go back to school and to make friends and be happy. Looking back I feel like that version of me was like paper, so unstable and so unaware of how simple minded i was. Then I met someone and fell in love. I have never wanted to marry someone and spend my life with someone before. and he hates me. he makes me hurt on purpose and yells at me to overwhelm me. he talks down to me and asks me why things are so hard for me to understand. but I am really starting to think its just my fault. I kind of deserve it. No one else would deserve it, but I do. I am autistic, so maybe i am just really stupid. maybe i provoke him every time without realizing or trying. maybe I am just especially annoying and awful to be around. I feel like I do not belong anywhere. Nobody wants me. I do not have any friends because i stopped texting them back. I do not have the energy to make new friends. I rarely go outside because I feel like I am in everyone is way. I miss my dogs. I just want a hug. I am so beyond tired and I have been looking for ways to do it but i cannot figure out what to do. I do not want to scar anyone or hurt anyone. I just want to go away and disappear. I was never meant to be on this planet in the first place. I was curious about how to get to the roof of a really tall building in the city closest to me, but maybe i would just be arrested for trespassing if i tried to split off from a tour and find my way up there? i want my mind to stop working and to end the stream of my consciousness and knowledge of my own personality and existence as soon as possible. i am truly alone and undeserving",Suicidal

Of course she is tired of it, who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though, I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world.

8928,"I think I am going to kill myself tonightI've been living with mental issues since about middle school. Mainly, being depressed and having a lot of issues with who I am/how I look. The only time that I started accepting myself was when I was in a relationship and had someone there to remind me that at least they thought I was attractive, and that was all that mattered. However, my insecurities eventually got the best of me and I became toxic and jealous, which led to the end of the relationship several months ago.I deserved that, and she deserved better. I know that I hurt her a lot, and I have trouble living with that. It also reduces my self image further, to where I have trouble living with myself in general. I think I was incredibly lucky to have been in a relationship with someone like that, and I do not think it will happen again. I do not want it to happen again, because I know it would end the same way. I have been in therapy and help groups since the break up trying to deal with myself and be a better person, but I have not noticed any improvement.I think at this point I am just a burden and holding the people around me back. I am always bringing up my issues and wanting to deal with them, but it is just at a point now where no one wants to see me anymore because of that.

You should be grateful for all the things you have.""My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own.

I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism, he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs, but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassed/annoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 24/7 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself.

Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete, my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected, and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to, all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless, pathetic loser. I just want to die, but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it, so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore.

8942,"Hello. I have read alot of people on here(suicide and depression groups) who actually encourage suicide and that is never okay. I am not wanting people who can relate to these feelings but rather hoping someone who is online is an advocate or something who can give me hope. I am in a very bad/dark mindset and I am contemplating suicide. I have been for over a month but tonight I am truly having the mindset to go forth. I have a legit(to **ME**) reason as to why I am contemplating. I do not want to go into details on here as I got hate earlier for reaching out with my reasoning. I was told I was pathetic and ridiculous for wanting to end my life over said reason and was told to get over it and move on when I strictly asked for that not to do be mentioned.The suicide hotline is not cutting it... it makes me uncomfortable. I want to be able to talk about my issues but I cannot as I have no one. The one person I did have.... is gone and now I am like this... Alone and contemplating ending it all.(get help seek a doctor seek meds move on get over it quit relying on someone else for happiness time heals etc) are all things I do not need to hear. They make matters worse. they are cliche and there is a reason why therapists avoid using those.One, I am seeking help on here. Two, I reached out to a new therapist. Three, I do not like meds. Four, I cannot move on or get over my situation. Five, I do not rely on someone else for happiness they just so happened to be the only shred of happiness I had in life. Six, time does not heal. Sometimes time will because things to fade to a certain extent... but it is not that way for EVERYONE. If time healed and people got over everything(cliche) this group would not exist. Suicide would not exist. So to be as short as I can. I am going through the biggest/worst event of my life. I am alone. I am sad. I am heartbroken. I have no one and I mean that. Family told me to ""either kill yourself or shut the hell up I am tired of hearing crying and about you being sad."" I do not get out of my house much. I am an introvert with super bad IBS who is scared of everything... literally. So no I do not have any friends. I *had* one true person in life. Anyways, I have gone through death. Watched some of the closest people to me die awful death's. The worst being a death brought on by cancer. Watched her deteriorate after the diagnosis-radiation and chemo, and within a year of diagnosis she died in hospice. Last moments with her she was not there. She was so doped up on pain meds she could not talk and did not know who we were. And STILL this pain I am facing now as awful as that sounds.... does not even begin to amount to this pain I am feeling now. I am wanting to end my life. I can end my life so easily right now but a small piece of me wants to hang on or I would not be on here. Sure it is sad and pathetic I am on here for help but it is HERE FOR A REASON because some people still care about others in life even if it is strangers. Is there a safe video chat or some kind of chat(not suicide hotline-convos too short) that does not have a time limit? If not, I just need hope. I need to hear that there is always hope. I know you do not know what my situation is or why I am asking for hope, but if it is true, my situation does not matter. There IS hope. I need just a small amount. Just a tad so I can NOT go over the edge. I want to talk about why I am feeling this way SO BAD but I know I will get hate... even if it is one person out of 10 or so. Someone is going to give me hate and make me feel more like shit or they are going to say the one thing's I have said I cannot bare to hear anymore. Please... anyone? Hope. I am alone and broken...

8943,"So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty",Depression

8945,"It makes me laugh, in a half-shocked-half-depressed kind of way, that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved, it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful: work, relationships, nature, but above all, meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head, disturbed, mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then, is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so, how sick is it to try to change the mind itself, to try to convince it that no, pain is actually fine, there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way, that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day, collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside, into nature, to find friends and do real, meaningful activities with them, to get away from all the stress, anger, and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life, with meaningful work, meaningful goals, meaningful friendships, but above all, a way to find meaning in every action, to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better.

8956,"I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that, living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try, i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore, i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father, the occasional kick or punch i can deal with, but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house, Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it, eating it, or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am, how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why, but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah, she was a friend of my GF and me at the time, and when shit hit the fan she was there for me, i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me, i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a job""It would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself"" That still sticks with me today, i think about it every single time i get closer to someone, every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right, that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh, maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it, or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point, when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing, then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong, and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone, if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks, when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore, every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this, you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore, or atleast not as myself.",Depression

8959,"I was given emergency surgery to repair testicular torsion back in 2017 and to this day I believe the surgery was botched in some way. I get frequent spells of extreme testicular pain that resonates throughout my lower abdomen. Not a minor annoyance either, pain so bad I sometimes have to go to the ER because I have reason to believe it is another torsion. Tonight makes the fifth trip to the ER with nothing wrong and no treatment given, along with several urologists throughout the years. Now, I am trans and am interested in an orchiectomy for both medical reasons and dysphoria. However, I still do not know *for sure* if my testicles are the issue. I have seen several hypotheses given through the years, ranging from bladder infections to just really, really bad cases of ""blue balls."" If my orchiectomy happens (my consultation is in early-August) and this mysterious chronic pain persists, I have no choice but to eat buckshot. I cannot take it anymore and this surgery is my last hope. These periods of intense pain have cost me a job, they have cost me social opportunities, and they have cost my family a fortune in American medical bills. Because of this, I feel horrifically guilty for constantly needing to go to the ER and having no diagnosis or treatment to show for it. While they are very understanding and thoroughly supportive, I cannot shake the intrusive thought that they are annoyed and think I am just being a hypochondriac.As I write this, I am stoned off my ass. I use cannabis to cope because I do not know what else to do. I am not enjoying this high right now either, because I am still in a fair amount of pain. The ER sometimes sends me home with prescriptions for opiates, but I have seen what those do to people and refuse to let myself use them, because I know I will become physically, and eventually psychologically, addicted to them. I do not use alcohol to cope either because it is also incredibly dangerous to rely on for chronic pain relief. I am 100% banking on this surgery. If this inexplicable pain returns post-recovery, I am not sure I will be able to take it any longer. If I were a cis man, I would have probably killed myself after three years of this. My orchiectomy is my last chance to live a pain-free life.",Suicidal
8960,"I was heavily considering killing myself in December 2019, and honestly, the idea was never completely out of my head prior to that either. I wish I did. I wish every single day that I did.Things were finally getting better and I had just received a handful of amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities the week before the pandemic officially started a you.S. lockdown. I had one week. Just one week that I did not think about dying every single morning and every single night.Everything has been hell. I lost my apartment and had to move home because the person I moved in with went absolutely insane and had a total breakdown and started aggressively forcing me to live by her conspiracy theory rules. (Covid is spread via the sidewalk, covid is spread via open windows in the air two stories up, the windows needed to be boarded up, never once leaving the apartment in a year, etc.)Covid is a completely different experience for those who have significant others and a stable living situation. I had neither. I tried so hard to go on dating sites so I would not be completely alone. But people would lovebomb me and then when I was invested they would start being abusive and degrading and cruel. I gave up.It feels like women genuinely do not care about anything other than their boyfriends no matter how progressive or new age they are. All of my female friends revolved their entire lives around their boyfriends since the pandemic started, and honestly before that too.I hate being home. I despise it. But I social distanced as much as possible. I was guilted or shamed by people for going out, and guilted and shamed by people for staying in. It felt like all my female friends would always justify that they constantly visited their boyfriends, or spent all their time with their boyfriends. But if I ever saw a friend once a month, it was frowned upon.Why? Why is it so taboo and wrong for me to be social just because it was not with someone who I was fucking.My friends all made me realize that it is impossible to ever get structure unless I somehow manage to find a significant other. But I have tried so hard to date and almost every time has been a traumatic experience.I am so jealous of them. I hate them. I do not want to hate my friends. But I feel so angry. I feel so misunderstood. Absolutely NONE of the people who judged me would ever go through what I went through.I moved back home with my parents from a huge city to a town with 800 people. My parents, I love very much but they are both abusive. I did not have a choice. I had to leave my apartment because my roommate had stopped working and paying rent. I would have had to pay the entire 2 bedroom rent if I stayed.I feel like a burden. I wish I had just died. there is no place for me in this world. I have not been happy in two years. I lost everything. I will never have a life that is rewarded in a pandemic. I am not meant to be happy &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I will only ever destroy my life and I do not deserve happiness I wish I killed myself before the pandemic",Suicidal

Maybe she is right.&amp;#x200B;I am shitty, the world is ending, and I am a fat, unloveable piece of shit anyway.

I do not care about being strong or fighting adversity, I just want to be at peace. I live for myself and Id be happiest not being stressed. I may miss out on finding a great love, but at least I save myself from experiencing heartache. I just feel life is a sham, by design, and I do not enjoy playing the game. I am tired of it!

There are a whole heck of a lot of stars in space out there too.Compared to me, space is too large. So who cares about a tiny human like me? I have got a finite number of years to spend yet I am spending every waking moment not having enough energy to move.Strangely enough, the thought of things that matter much more than my life motivates me to move and do things sometimes.

8971,"Hi, My name is steven. I am 21 and my fiance and I have 5 kids, 1 when I was 18, twins when I was 19 and twins when I was 21. Well I am about to be 22, and my fiance just got a pregnancy test and she saw a faint line. I love my kids and my fiance so much. But I do not know if I can do it again. I am so exhausted and I am always so stressed and scared and when she told me the first thing I thought was at least they would get checks if I did it. I have manic bipolar and I have come to know the signs of when I am going to become manic and this is always the fist step and I am scared. I know its hard to believe and you might not believe me and just think I am doing this for attention but I do not know who to go to. We see the same therapist and I cannot talk to her because I do not want her to think I am not a good dad. I do not have freinds because I have a full time job and I am a full time father. I know I am dumb for having this many kids so early buts she has the iud and I have noone and I am so scared. So please just one person believe me so I have someone to talk to. Someone to talk to",Suicidal
8972,"I do not know anymore. I just cannot feel happy or anything good, I am always sad and I am constantly telling myself that I *should* be happy. I am doing the things that used to make me happy, but I just feel empty. And then this compared to some of the shit my friends go through, like my friend who is dad started another family whilst still being married to his mom, and he can persist, I, on the other hand, cannot persist after anything negative. And by anything negative it could literally be me listening to some of the music I like (a band I enjoy listening to has some very odd music and if I am feeling some way I can be sent into an episode of sort, ending in me either hurting myself or crying for hours on end, or having to lean on somebody, and that option has been completely scratched off so its only two ig). I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for quite some time, I just do not see the need to keep pointlessly wade through pain for a mediocre at best experience. I probably hurt myself maybe once or twice a month, usually just like cutting myself on the thigh. I honestly do not think Id be missed when/if I go. My parents want absolutely nothing to do with me, probably because I am a dead beat who cannot get shit done, and when it comes to graded I am like a B student. And then I have like two actual friends, one of which I can barely talk to because her parents strongly dislike me because I would always have to lean on her for support, and she was the only person who could help me while being willing to help me. But apparently I was putting too much pressure on her so I am only allowed to talk to her whenever her parents are around. And my other friend just does not understand what I go through. Anyways I am sorry for whoever read that and idk i do not think I am in direct threat to a suicide (I might like cut myself later though) and I am sorry for wasting your guys time. I just want help and I am sorry because Ill be no help to anyone trying to help me because I do not even know what is wrong, ig it comes back to probably my favorite lyric someone help me understand what is going on inside my mind. I am so y for being a bitch and do not feel obligated to help me, thanks if you try I do not know what to title this but I think I might need help",Suicidal
8973,"I am 18, soon 19 and,wondering why not save up some cash, and go to a obscure place to end it. Have one last blast before I go. Or in my case first,one day to live.

Kill theme with kindness, but I digress. My whole life up to 18 was boring? wasted?. And know I am close to 19 trying to get into art. Well obviously I am awful, I could have started years earlier,been happy,Alas I feel this is the finale thing to push me. Ill never be happy doing anything else. Art is my passion yet I wasted 18 years gaming. Too little to late I guess. No fucking good artist started at 18. Even vangough drew when he was young, for some reason hes always an example of a late bloomer. I want to join the military, kill or be killed. I feel its were useless dregs like me belong.

I feel like life carved a path of destruction for me to follow, die in a bloody useless war.

Inject myself with pain killers, and adrenaline. Then strip myself clean,of this disgusting curse. Finally I pull the trigger and die clean. Ill finally be happy with my people.

8974,"How do I figure out if I deserve help. I mean mostly deserve a therapist's time to work with a patient. Do I deserve their time regardless of the money I pay them? I just have too many questions for them.Also does it sound illogical when I say that I do not want to take deep breaths and calm myself---because that means ignoring the anxiety, and treating it like something that is overreacting, that needs to be fixed. Treating the anxiety as wrong/not okay. I thought you should treat the anxiety as a friend and live with it. Not shush it from the conscience. Thanks. Do I deserve help",Depression

Ads, movies, songs, books, LITERALLY fucking everything involving a woman is basing her worth on her looks and fuckability. Its making me so depressed and anxious and I am finding it hard to trust the men in my life. I know not all men see women as sex objects, but the subconscious conditioning is real. Every man I have ever been friends with had initially wanted a sexual or romantic relationship with me. I feel hopeless and disgusted and just ready to stop existing in such a gross world.

8998,Every second of the day I am on the edge of having a panic attack (I had my first last year in November) it felt like I was going crazy and words did not make sense I felt this fear over come my body I felt as if I was seeing the world through a phone and I did not feel present if that makes sense. I suffer with really bad social anxiety but during my panic attack I wanted to run up to random people and ask this if everything was going to be okay and to make sure I was fine. I got lightheaded because of the terror in my body and my hands and legs were going cold and numb. I seriously wanted to die during it all it lasted about 20 minutes and then calmed down a bit to where I could at least keep myself fighting to want to live. I have not had a full blown panic attack like that again but ever since I know the feeling I have this fear of having it again and will get random waves of that anxiety I had before I had my panic attack which just makes me freak out more. I do not want to self diagnose so I am just going to say I have this intrusive thoughts that I am becoming schizophrenic 24/7 so the most random things will trigger me that never did before and I obsess over it 1000 times after that questioning why it did and come to the conclusion I am losing it. If I hear a song on the radio and the voice is kind of weird or the beat is somewhat scary I imagine scary things and my brain will start glitching out but I think it is because of the fear in my head and I am just fabricating my fears.

""I am like but you blastin music."" he is all ""You irritating more ppl than me, now I turned it down, now put yours out."" I am like ""No"" Then he snitches to bus driver and I call him a snicth. Then he is all the like ""your Mama's a snitch"" meanwhile I put it out and he turns back up the gangsta rap and starts rapping obnoxiously. Then bus driver starts threatening to kick me off and bout a fucking mask. So I put on a scarf. We eventually all get kicked off for me smoking and the gangsta rap. Moral is everyone want listen to gangsta rap but nobody can do gangsta shit. they talk the talk but cannot walk the walk. Nobody can handle the reality of it. Everytime somebody does she me gangsta shit someone winds up snitching, wining or going against it. Everyone claims to be from the hood, wears gangsta clothing: baggy pants,Jordans cortezes, white tee and gold teeth but nobody can handle the lifestyle. I am a rebel, outlaw, I do shit that goes against the law and IDGAF I do not dress like a gangsta and do not claim to be one but I hate people so fuck them. I am always smoking on bus I never where a mask and I I play my loud ass music. But do I complain when others do the same? No. I always get kicked off the bus and will continue too.

9014,"So, I am a few months shy of 21, I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and, right now, my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine (I used to be a nursing student, now I am seeking medical school) and that, associated with quarantine, made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this, I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family, especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations.

While the antidepressants originally gave me sleeping issues I am starting to notice something that others probably would not consider a problem: I often wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep, not even being tired. I have never had so little sleep without further impact, the lowest amount I have had before when I was relaxed has been around 6 hours.I know that there is a little chance to have specific genes that allow low amount of sleep. However I wondered if my observations might be due to antidepressants changing the brain activity in the long run.Have any of you had similiar experience with sleeping quality after going off antidepressants?PS: I suspect that I have had dysthymia through my whole life with some depression episodes inbetween so maybe my sleep quality increased because I am finally fine - something that I wish for every single one of you!

I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead. There is so much more I want to say about having depression and being a mother, but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that, so yeah. It sucks, but get help.

9060,"Just to clarify, **I have never told anyone that I have wanted to die because of them, and I will never do something that in my life.**But... What I have done, having realized that yesterday, is something **very** selfish...In the past years, I used to tell some of the closest friends I have ever had about my feelings of suicide, like I felt sad, empty or than I wanted to catch the bus, including a time I engaged into self-harm once or twice, **(but I never told them it was because of them or something similar).** I also told the same things to people I used to know from the internet...What I did... Is **unforgivable.**I put such a huge **burden on them**, I think I made them feel they were responsible for my happiness... Even if that was not my intention, even if I tried to reciprocate things to them as much as I could; the **damage** was done.Those things should only be told either to qualified mental health professionals with decades of study, or in anonymous forums with people who have similar problems, but either the anonymity or professional relationship have boundaries to ensure the person who listens will not end up feeling guilty or responsible.Maybe that is the main reason I ended up being mostly alone... Even if I was desperate for help, I asked for it in the most horrible way I could have ever done...They moved on because they deserved to be happy, they deserved to be surrounded with positive people who love them, they deserved all the good things in the world...Something that a useless, toxic and cowardly person like me would never be able to provide... Even if I was hurt a lot, even if society ended up betraying me, I should have never asked that kind of advice to them... Honestly... I do not think I have ever been a good person at all... Ever since I was a child I have had trouble connecting with people, my way of being (like how I speak, walk and express myself), pissed them off so much that they ended up bullying me as punishment, or they slowly ignored me until I got the message and moved away from their lives.Heh, and I thought I could be a hero... What kind of hero does that?What kind of **decent** human being does something like that?Like someone told me once, even if I never had bad intentions towards them, my **final actions** were the ones that mattered the most.Aristotle said that there are friendships based either on affinity, utility and true love...Aside from some exceptions, I think most of the friendships I have ever had in my life were about utility and affinity, with very few ones based on true love...And if deep inside my core I am not a good person, it explains why I have to suffer like this as punishment. I think I have been a manipulator...",Suicidal
9061,"Hi guys I am a 18F and I feel like I am falling back into a state of depression. I feel like part of it is because it is summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do. Throughout the day I am just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression. I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I am not necessarily suicidal. I do not really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends. This gives me some joy but then after it is done I fall back into that sad state. I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I do not deserve to be depressed or sad.

9062,"Below me the oceans waves crashed into the rocks. The ocean stretched out as far as the eyes could see, the artwork of God that makes real life seem like a dream.It was almost 6pm, the sun was setting and it painted a beautiful shade of orange on the oceans surface. A sunset is one of the most beautiful sights you could ever witness. However, the sun setting above the ocean its beauty can barely be described. I was standing on a cliff above the ocean, about 10 feet from the edge. My mind and body was sending waves of warnings about the dangers that awaited if I went any closer. Danger ahead it whispered, your safer here. The human brain has an unprecedented instinct for survival. I took a few steps forward and the warnings multiplied. Stop fucking walking the voice screamed. I was three feet closer to the edge of the cliff now and I could truly see the whole ocean ahead of me. I took sometime to bask in its beauty. I was standing still so the voice dwindled but still conspicuously whispered go fucking back.I involuntarily began reminiscing on the tragedy that is my past. The pain and agony inflicted on me by the world, the hell I went through in the hands of others, the betrayals from those I trusted, my regrets, the ones I have lost, the embarrassments, and humiliations I endured and most especially the catastrophes I personally inflicted upon myself and those I love due to my slavery to my desires and greed.The rest, I could find ways to cope with because the malevolence of the world and the human-beings that run it is not obscure, except to the hopelessly naive (which I was a part of for the longest time). I found it most onerous however to handle the last one for one simple reason; its one thing to be going through rejection, torment and suffering and its another thing to go through these things with the irrefutable knowledge that you are responsible for majority, if not all of it. Agony that is your fault is a special type of pain.I took more steps forward and my brain fired into overdrive survival mode. It was shrieking at me at this point. Its words incoherent but its meaning crystal clear.Death is close.Shockwaves of fear and terror flowed through me from head to toe and all I could perceive was the 50 feet drop into a belligerent ocean that crashed steadfastly into a bunch of jagged rocks, its thunderous boom promised to pull me into the everlasting warmth of oblivion if I fell, where my body would probably never be found.I was at the edge of the cliff now and my whole life had flashed through my eyes. Then I heard those words. I am seeing someoneThe phrase that drove me over the deep edge. The phrase that represented the coalescence of all my ignorant, vacuous, naive, selfish, greedy and gullible decisions.I still remember exactly how those words made me feel.Standing on the edge of the cliff with every molecule of my body screaming for me to turn back, I realized an important, simple fact.The pain and tragedy of my past and present just has to feel more overwhelming than my fear of demise to make turning back to my reality feel more painful than taking one more step. Standing on the edge of this cliff I deeply understood this feeling. I am in so much pain, I feel so alone all the time even when I am around those who love me so dearly. I do not understand how to make things better. I do not know if things will ever get better. So far its gone from bad to worse to agonizing and I do not know how to bear these feelings anymore. Nothing indicates that things will get better. Signs keep pointing to things getting worse. I feel so tired of being me and it feels easier to just take one more step.I turned back and walked away, for my family, who have loved me far more than I have ever loved myself. I know a lot of us on here are struggling. I wrote a short prose, I hope it gives someone solace.",Suicidal

I have always been a caring person and I have always been as nice as i can be but the world just constantly throws it back in my face. growing up with r\*pe, sexual and emotional abuse for years from my stepfather (and physical abuse from his romantic interests) alongside the murder? suicide? of my mom, i do not even know anymore what happened to herand that is hurting too. I am tired. i do not know if ""things will get better"" is true at all. I am 22 now and nothing has gotten better. all of the family that might have cared for me are dead now or i just do not talk to them because they have all of their own problems, not like a lot of them had ever gone through the effort to talk or help me anyways. its always been me, until foster care stepped in. cannot even mention the shittiness of that. my only escape used to be the internet, but at this point its less of an escape and just too much for me now toothere are little things in life i love, like my pets and my fiance and my friends, but i do not think i can make it any further in life. i do not want to drag them down with me while I am running out of money and literally deterriorating in front of my fiance, though i know I have already impacted his health. does not matter how much i try my best to be the best for him, I am just not good. the only ways i can function even just slightly is if I am high on anything. I have tried hard not to get into alcohol or do anything that might harm my body but i already have it pretty bad there anyways so i do not even know if its worth tryign to preserve myself at all. all i ever got told growing up from people who cared is that I am strong for living through what i did but it is too hard to get over those things when they impede my daily living constantly. i cannot go outside or i have terrible anxiety attacks, cannot work for the same reason. i can hardly buy groceries without either being in too much pain or suffering from these anxiety issues. needless to say the ptsd and insomnia make sleep almost impssible to come by and not at all refreshing. even just writing this reminds me that i just have too many problems and not a single solution for them has worked and I am tired of trying to fix things, using energy i do not have to do these things and try to live i just want to sleep and never wake up or maybe ill go on a walk and get hit by a car and die or something with my luck.

I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression

Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home.

I was wondering if it is depression because I can count how many times I have been happy the past few months and I really hate how I feel most of the time, I use day dreaming and weed now as a way to escape but every time reality hits harder.

9081,"So I am not exactly suicidal but I just do not feel like being alive. I am only 18 and this is my 2nd time going through some serious trama, a few years ago my best friend took her own life and I got help for that but now I got this other type of trama that most do not even consider trama. it is called betral trama, it happens when someone your super close to does something that is unforgivable to you but unlike normal PTSD you have this need to be around them. And it can come from a parent or a relationship, mine is from a relationship. I used to be able to meditate, and when I meditate I sometimes go into sleep paralysis so... Not the best time to have flashbacks everytime. But I am in this pretty constant state of hopelessness to where I am constantly wishing I was not alive but I do not really want to die, and I do not want my ex back but also do even tho I know how toxic and inconsiderate she was. But I am just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to get rid of these feelings because I cannot keep living like this it is been a month and I still have no clue what to do. Idk what to do",Depression
9082,"My emotions, or lack of, scare me. Over the past couple of months I have noticed that I just seem to care less and less. Literally anything could happen to me or around me and I do not know why but nothing seems to make me feel normal emotions. Two events made me super aware of my new emotional numbness. A couple months ago I got into a bad accident with my mother and she was freaking out and crying and I just sat there. I was not scared, or sad, or in shock. I was sitting in a wrecked car ready to continue the trip and move on to the next destination. Then the other time was when my dad was mad at me for something and he yelled at me and told me how disappointed he was and I again just sat there staring at him. Even after he left I just sat there then continued on with what I was doing. I feel like maybe I might be going crazy because of how numb I am sometimes. But at the same time I like being numb because I do not like having to feel. I struggle to have emotions sometimes (a little rant)",Depression

I do not get why I am drowning in my own misery while people have it worse. I remember in school we asked the question if a character in the book was weak or not for committing sucide. Every single person said weak. I do not see myself as a weak person and i do not think anyone who thinks about ending it is weak. I just think they want peace and they are tired. I am tired.

9091,"As a child, I always told myself and people that I would be a French teacher. Not a dream job per se, but one supposedly reachable, right?At the beginning of high school, I decided to learn Swedish and fell completely in love with the language, the culture, the country as a whole. My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in Sweden.But it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me up.Why? Well, I stutter and have other speech issues. My stutter is not that terrible unless I am in a stress-inducing situation, there it can get pretty bad. Even worse, I tend to... dissociate (? I do not think this is the right word) after a bad stutter. This is a terrible thing to happen as a teacher, right?I am also anxious, have very low self-esteem and my social batteries run low most the time. What if it is too much work for my apathetic ass? What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia. I was never able, in school, to stand up and go to the blackboard. I was never able to speak in front of other people. At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live. Either way, I am physically not in shape and have a particularly bad spine (the wonderful aftermath of a fractured vertebra that had to heal on its own...), yet most jobs about nature require to be in pretty good shape.I have seen young adults, usually friends, buy a farm and work together. It would be amazing for me to have this opportunity. But I know no one, I have no training in farm jobs and then again I am physically in not so great shape.This autumn will be my third attempt at completing the first year of Northern studies. I have been trying to complete it ever since 2018 and in 2020-2021 I did nothing of my life. I feel horrible. How am I supposed to get by in life as an adult if I cannot even complete a University year in a study field that I adore?I am such an inconvenience and a disappointment.

I was so detached that I could not feel the pain in my feet. But when I got back to the hospital I realized that my feet were swollen to the size of a melon and I had blood blisters so large I could hardly walk.I have dissociated before but this time it was severe. It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home.

I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not.

In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then.

I got told I should probably just kill herself because unattractive people do not end up happy. I was not even 10 yet, just that little girl. Then that little girl started to grow up.

Maybe id just stop caring about everything so there is nothing to be i guess sad or feel empty about. that is maybe when it gets better. Somehow it does not feel worth the wait and stopping the routine earlier feels more natural. Why live when it amounts to nothing. What is this all worth",Suicidal

9115,"Never imagined posting something publicly on the internet. My depression started in my early childhood. In my family I was an unnecessary child. My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said ""I love you"" to me all I ever heard was ""why cannot you learn from your sister"". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were ""why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life"" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became ""friends"" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves. Writing this made me tear up a lot reminding me how shit life is and that the only way to fix it is by ending it. Every step I take leads me closer to suicide.",Suicidal

I am coming here because its honestly sad and I am just losing my interest. Maybe I should move on and get other friends the problem is we live in a very small town and there really is not many people. I do like going to my aunts house though she is awsome and I go there quite frequently. So maybe Ill just ditch the friends and go see her more and more often. I just wanted to see other peoples take on this. I do not know if I am the only one with this problem or not but well see. The spark though with hanging out with my friends is not there anymore. Ill be sitting there wanting to talk but then I stop my self because it is not worth it anymore. Their usually on their phones and its just the same old shit different day. I hangout with them maybe like once every two weeks. It used to be more. They usually ask me to hangout more than that but I say I cannot because I do not really want to because its going to be the same shit every time.

9127,"I am not looking for sympathy or kind words. I just need to briefly open the vent that I so frequently forget is closed.Have you ever seen one of those charity coin spiral devices? You would put a coin in, and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first, then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller, until an audible chink, and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole - a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral, maybe not at the bottom, but far from the top, and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral, but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer, slowly deteriorating, having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments, all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds, and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am, by choice, disconnected from society, and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort, and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong, and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself, and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look, to the way I interact with people, to every nuance that defines who I am - an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore, and having largely withdrawn from society, I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day - waking up and maintaining myself for nothing, just to live another day in pain, a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day, and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist', but less productive - at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to, I sleep when I pass out from tiredness, I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore, and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend, as I know I will lose interest eventually, have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone, and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether, so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have, and make excuses often for why ""I cannot talk today"". I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future, I see a make-believe fantasy of what could never exist, nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor, and so I prolong my existence with video games and make-believe - a distraction, a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game, the day dream, the false fantasy, and remove the veil of distraction, I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy, in which I am expected to be grateful, a world that I am expected to enjoy, but do not. Every day I see the spiral steepening, and feel my speed towards the centre increasing. I am not sure when the slope of the spiral will become to steep to maintain my spin and drop me into the darkness of the unknown, but I am slipping. A Spiral Into The Inevitable",Depression

9132,"Made homemade burritos for the first time in a long time. I had it all planned out and my kitchen gets super hot so I was sweating the whole time. Only to find at the end, my skillet is too shallow to strain the grease from the beef which that must have been some REALLY high fat meat. It did not dawn on me until about 5 minutes ago I could have just used a paper towel to strain off the grease.The nacho cheese sauce I decided to buy ended up overpowering my seasonings and completely overshadowed everything except the oil in the beef.So you could not taste the baby spinach, the rice, the tomatoes, the onion, nothing. Just nacho cheese sauce and oil. It was not bad, but it really made me feel incompetent. You know, I have been studying and studying on how to cook and season stuff properly and what seasons work well with others. Like for this, it was onion powder, chili powder, ground cumin and salt and pepper. could not taste any of it.For the refried beans, I also got some green chili sauce with lime, figuring it would really jazz up the flavors in the beef as you bit down. Topped with the rice, nacho cheese sauce, Colby cheese shredded, tomatoes and baby spinach on top to keep it away from the heat so it would not wilt and get that sort of really strong iron taste.I put a LOT of thought into this and it just ends up turning out meh. It was barely distinguishable from the likes of Taco Bell. I sweat my ass off in that kitchen and I put in all that work for that...it is depressing to me, i know that may be stupid but I genuinely tried. I have got a few lessons from it though so, I might try it again in the future. But for now it just kind of sits in my head and my fridge because it is just bleh Ick...",Depression

But since I do not have anybody else to talk to I might aswel vent here before I decide to off myself. &amp;#x200B;So today I lost my job. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming from miles away but on the other hand, I wish it did not happen or atleast I would wish to be able to turn back time to prevent some things from happening. But we do not have such a thing, so my life is fucked either way.So, the first week of 2020 I gave up a deadbeat, no life job for something promising, something with a future. Raised out of a family where such a thing is an impossibility, I could have atleast try. Everything was fine, I loved the job, It was physical, it was a challenge, I felt... Happy. 3 months later, I find myself in hospital. I broke my ankle at my job. Again, in hindsight, my fucking mistake. I twisted my ankle at a location where it happened once shortly before, but a donkey does not hit the same rock twice in a row right? Right. I spend 2 months in a cast, longer than what was expected and another month out of the cast before I could even attempt going to work. That should have raised an alarm bell. I wanted to go back to work, so I went earlier than what was recommended. And such, I went to work; They gave me adjusted work, essentially I had to sit in an office like space, controling valves, pumps and monitors. But no matter what I did, how patient my boss was the pain endured. And weeks of adjusted work became months, months turned into a year. The pain stayed the same to the cost of several different treatments. Every step I take on that foot is the same as getting stabbed. Even when I did not stand on it for 4 hours, 10 minutes of walking made the pain come back, 50x worse than it was before. And as my inactivity began to extend, so did my weight. And in the meantime, gossip &amp; bullying started to become a regular occurence. To the point where the bullies claimed I did not deserve a lunch break, or that I am doing nothing but sit on my ass an entire day... I had multiple talks about it, every time the promise of betterment was made. But every time, the bullying became worse. My mental state began to decline. Up to the point where I left half an hour earlier because I could not take the abuse no more and told my boss how I felt. And so, I was brought up for a final conversation. I could not even defend myself this time. ""it is time to let you go"", and was ordered to give everything back, from keys to badge... &amp;#x200B;This job was all I had. it was my jumpstart to a better life, a one time opportunity that was wasted because of a fucking accident that dominated my entire career. And it is all my fault. If I was not fat, my ankle could heal properly. If I did not show anger and frustration all the time, I could have kept my job.If I was not honest about how I felt, I could have kept my job. At home, I have nothing, nobody. Because of Corona, all my friendships watered down to the point where they did not reply back. Work was all I had. And now I do not have anything. Nobody to talk to, nobody to vent to. Alone, at the age of 26. Sad fuck. For years I have felt miserable but it was do-able, manageable even. But now I feel worse than that. A sorrow that drowns me out with no sign of ever getting better, not to mention the physical pain I have at the moment. I cannot take it no more... If I was not this ugly blob of meat I could have had somebody to support me right now. I am going to OD myself on both pain, antidepressants and alchohol later this week and pray it works. I am just going to make some arrangements until then. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to share my story for the record. Even though it is vague and incomplete. Alright, so...

9138,"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone &lt;3",Depression

I would go to school and fight the other kids, distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment.

Her pupils would change when she was drunk, I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old, still living with my mother, stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree, determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance, anger, depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking, supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing, I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives. ""The areas not safe, people there will hurt you."" ""You will not like it it will be boring."" ""you are bad at maths, you will not be able to do it.""I have a solid exterior, I am a fully grown man now, I am tall, broad, the one thing my father gave me was good genes. I am capable, I am strong, intelligent. I have held down jobs in the past, I was a manager before I went to university.Tonight I ask her to not be so negative, I ask her why she cannot just be happy and support me for trying to better my life.. she tells me that she has done her 18 years of service to me. She says I am holding onto the energy of the past, that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish, a narc, that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain, I feel alone, there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me, there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need.. There is nobody there who will truly help me..I feel so jealous of people who were raised in a loving environment. I watch people I went to school with living life, driving, living independently.. Here I am, barely able to make enough to pay off my debts, let alone save enough to leave.. The rent in my city is insane.I tried supported housing for 6 months, but living around a house full of people with hardcore drug issues made me feel like I was still at home.. People trying to come into my room.. Dirt and grime everywhere outside of my door.. Shit on the sink in the shared bathroom..Everything is so hard. I am struggling to keep fighting. I cannot tell anyone how I feel in real life, I am supposed to be this big, impenetrable guy who people can rely on..When I try to speak to people, nobody takes. It seriously.How much more can I take? When will life cut me a break? I just want to be happy, I just want to be independent, away from damaged, crazy people.. 22M - Narc alcoholic parent",Depression

9146,"Sorry about this being so long, I have a lot in mind that I feel is all relevant to each other.I have been trapped in my house for months since I have left my job. I left because I did not feel comfortable being there and every passing day felt like a drag. I was not happy with the thought of me working 66 manual labor hours with only a single day off to really do anything for what might be the rest of my life. In hindsight, I think most of the reason why I hated being there was because I was always drowsy. I would stay up really late (because I hated work) and would have to wake up early. The entire time spent here at the house since I have left work, I have done absolutely nothing to try to improve myself. I want to go back to work because I feel like a bum for being unemployed, but I just cannot right now. My biggest worries about going back to work are either that I am going to be fired immediately (because of my general low energy caused by my depression) or that I am going to be ridiculed endlessly by my future coworkers because of my awkwardness. I do not know how long Ill last working there with all the abuse I am undoubtedly going to get. I have thought about what exactly is it that makes me such an easy target of ridicule and I have come up with a few reasons. The number one reason is that I am boring. I have little to no interest in anything. This really sucks because I have plenty of ideas on what things I can get into to make me more interesting, yet I can never bring myself to do anything about it. I GENUINELY do not care about anything and it makes me sad knowing that so long I do not do anything to improve, Ill forever have this problem of being boring and being the constant butt of everyone is jokes everywhere. I honestly feel like I am undeserving of any human dignity with the way people talk to me. Like if I am not allowed to have any pride. I often question my intelligence for what I think are pretty good reasons. I graduated from High School with no intention of going to college because I was completely mentally burnt out by the end of it. To be fair, I think sleep deprivation had a lot to do with it (same reason as what I mentioned about work above). I literally told myself that I wish that I could turn off my brain and never have to think again. I do not know if its my sleep deprivation, stress, possible autism (undiagnosed), possible ADD (undiagnosed), or maybe even a learning disability, but I have a VERY difficult time learning anything. My brain literally HURTS when i think about anything and I just feel even worse emotionally for not understanding it. This depresses me for many reasons. One, being that I feel like a complete worthless idiot who will never amount to anything and who is a slave to manual labor work. Two, It makes learning any skill more difficult tenfold. Three, I just simply hate being stupid. I look up to the intellectual types. I value intelligence over any other human quality trait and it makes me sad that Ill never feel like I am good enough to have friends, to have a soulmate, to be a father one day, or to even play a respectable role in society. Ill forever be some dumb laborer in the eyes of the people around me. Despite all of these things mentioned that bother me, I just cannot bring myself to do anything about it. I cannot go back to work because of the mental state that I am in. I will not last. I cannot pick up new hobbies/interests because I honestly do not care about anything. The abuse will never end. I cannot learn any skills necessary to improve my financial future and overall social footing. My brain hurts trying. I feel completely stuck. It does not help that I do not know anyone personally who would honestly give a damn about me getting better besides my parents. I think its safe to say that my siblings, secondary family members, and friends (do not have any) would not care. I am on my own here. I cannot bring myself to commit suicide just yet, but I do not think Id be too bothered if I knew that tomorrow would be my last day alive. I do not have much to lose. I also feel like I am living a cycle that will keep repeating itself with no end in sight. Ill find a job that Ill hate but I muscle my way through it enough to be able to afford another break. Ill take said break but Ill feel like shit knowing that it was likely due to anxiety and Ill feel like a bum for being unemployed. But I cannot really learn anything useful to advance myself to a better future. So when the money that I saved up for the break is gone, its back to working my miserable job. The cycle repeats until the day that I die. Any advice or possible words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. If I do not get a single answer then that is fine, I am just happy to share this. I forgot to mention this earlier. I am 23, Male, and I have had depression and social anxiety since I was 13.

Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression. I became obsessed with death the more and more I read about transplants online, the mortality rate, life expectancy, etc, nobody even mentioned any of this to me before I got the transplant. In my country the person who has lived longer with a heart transplant it is been 21 years and is all can think about. I am not a good person and I have drank a lot in the last few years since it was the only thing that helped me forget about everything for some time, right now I just cannot do anything, I just cannot get out of the bed I cannot fake it anymore and smile like I everything is going to be okay. I do not want to go through a transplant again neither die in pain, I just want to die in peace, I wish I would have died in that bed before I took this heart from someone else, it could have been of better use.

9174,"When my dad tested positive for Covid after he was vaccinated with Astrazeneca, my life took a turn. He had to be brought to the hopsital and stayed there for 2 weeks. While we were there, we found out he was going to be homeless, not one of his relatives were willing to help us, I begged that he stayed at (his moms house where he grew up, but now its owned by his sister who is in the states) in a year or 2 until I could stand on my own (broken family, did not finish college, still starting my small food shop and living as a caretaker for my boyfriend's uncles house. In addition to all that, I also tested positive FOR THE SECOND TIME with covid. My dad needs insulin and I will have to pay for a new place to stay, food everyday, and his medication, (100$ every two weeks)... in the next 3 months (until the government provides free insulin, it will be 50$ less) I really felt alone and felt like I was the only one who loved my dad. My family knows I grew up without him with me, without him supporting me as I struggled thru life, though they might think that he deserved what he is going thru, I do not. I am just his kid that he did not abandoned when I was 8. I am 25 now and still trying to get my life together. As much as I would like to take him with me, I am staying 10hrs away from him for my shop here in a bigger City, I cannot pay for it. Now I know people who are willing to listen to me, but I do not want to burden them with a problem that money can solve... I have to move fast, I have to find a way. I have to not give up. But some days, I feel otherwise. And it is scaring me because all this love might not be enough for me to keep going. I am weak. And I want to escape this. I used to be just contented with going slow in earning money, but this time, it is urgent. I do not know what else to do. I easily get triggered whenever I see people collecting cash for non-life threatening situations and get tempted to ask help, is this my pride? I do not know. I just know that I am desperate and scared. ever felt like ur mental struggle is not valid becs what is causing it is financial issues",Suicidal
9175,"I feel burnt out. I like being by myself but I still feel envious of people with good connections to other people. I have no energy but caffeine gives me anxiety. I actually try to actively change things in my life by being more active, and I want you to know that exercise and being more social does help. it is just a little difficult to undo 8 years of depression. It feels like it is a part of my personality now if I am honest, and I do not think I would recognise myself without it.it is overwhelming thinking about how much I need to work in the future. I feel empty all the time. I just want to stop thinking. I tried counselling. It got annoying after some time as I was hoping for more insight to help me, but most of the time she just asks what I want to do. it is always the same follow-up question. It gets repetitive and does not feel like I am getting much value from it all the time. Maybe I just had the wrong expectations? Has anyone found counselling helpful?I have had medications too. It stops me from feeling intense sadness which helped, but I did not feel happy, just a void numbness. I am just tired, to be honest. What helps me keep going is just taking this life as an experience and not too serious. it is easier said then done though as I still cannot help but consider how other people think. I come from an asian family, and I do not want to bring shame to them, but living in a western country, I cannot help but dream of the freedoms my peers have.

9182,"I just really want to get this out, and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long, I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK, which means mental health is always a taboo subject, and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity, given I have done a lot of reading on the subject, and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school, excellent university, had great grades, show great social skills as a front whenever I need to, had a good job, then took a two years out and moved to Japan, and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong, I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",Depression
9183,"I do not know exactly why I am the way that I am, at first I would say that I am not depressed I do not match all the symptoms. That was an excuse obviously, then it got worse. It is a mix of shitty days and just being in the same room as my parents. I try hard to tell myself its not my parents fault you are this way but yes they are a big reason and coming to that realization really is disappointing. I do not know whether to keep asking my parents for help or just wait until I am old enough, but I have been thinkingShould I tell my friends? I do not want to force anything on them, or trauma dump on them. I just want to be acknowledged, I just want someone else to tell me you are not okay and need help besides me. I will talk to the wall for an hour telling myself all the reasons why. I want someone to know besides me? They do not even need to help, I just want the knowledge that someone else knows.

Idk what to do, I would love to make full transition, but it is really expensive and risky. I do not have anyone to talk about that and besides moments being woman( wearing sexy clothes, makeup and getting attention), I am constantly sad and often crying.

9192,"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy.At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety.A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place.Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her).This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone.If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook.

9208,"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy. At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety. A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place. Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her). This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone. If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook. If you read this far thanks, aware I am ranting now. Erectile dysfunction and alienation is ending me",Suicidal

There is an issue that has been persistent throughout our relationship though and that is her depression.She has tried many different medications and there are ups and downs. Unfortunately when it strikes she becomes extremely cold and cruel. She walks away from me mid conversation, locks herself in the bedroom, tells me to go away, not touch her, calls me names, says cruel things about me, creates fabrications and refuses to get out of bed and try to do anything to help her depression. She frequently tells me to leave her when in this state and that I would be better off without her.Once the spell is over she is back to her happy Loving self with cuddles and kisses and words of affirmation.Now I understand that these things are related to depression, but my concern is the outright toxic behavior. She says that it is because her depression makes her push people away, but I am starting to question if this is actually depression or just an excuse to be toxic.I understand I could have posted this on relationship advice and I might also do that, but the reason I am posting it here is to get insight from people that have and are sympathetic to depression.

It took me 6 years to get my bachelor's degree, while other people I know are getting their master's or getting accepted to medical school. I am currently trying to study for the MCAT but I cannot focus and end up crying all over my notes. It does not help that my parents always come to me whenever they need help with anything. I have an older brother but he does not do anything the the house, he treats the house like a hotel and my parents does not bat an eye. They do not discipline him at all and place all the pressure on me. My mom would also tell me that if anything happens to my parents that I need to take care of my brother, he is 26 years old. He does not have any mental disabilities. I am tired I want to move out but I do not have the money. What I hate most about my life is that I have no power whenever I try to tell my parents they need to try to solve problems by themselves or ask their other child they would get upset with me. They say I am the responsible one. I come from a traditional family, so as the oldest and the male should not he have more responsibility?

9229,"I am too much of a coward probably to go through with it, but I am honestly done. Everyday I wake up with intrusive thoughts racing through my head that make me anxious. I have no one to talk to, who will truly understand. I tried talking to my parents, and while my dad is understanding and listens, he has this tic (rubbing and licking his nose) that is extremely annoying and makes it almost unbearable to talk to him. He always takes it lightly and does not fucking change. When I try to sleep or even masturbate, this is what is on my fucking mind for some reason (stupid brain keeps replaying all the shitty sounds he makes). He also interrupts me a lot anyway, and while I know he loves me, I just cannot deal with this anymore. I have told my mom about this, and she keeps saying all the ""stay positive"" bullshit; do not go on social media, and all that. she is probably right about the latter, but it is gotten to a point where I cannot change. She makes fun of me for crying and feeling low all the time, I guess it would make sense since I am in my early 20s and I should move past being so damn sensitive.

I have a full-time software engineering job, I am in good physical health, and I have plans to go to grad school. Through college, I thought that if I work hard, I can enjoy later. I never went to parties, drank, smoked through my four years. But none of that matters. When my mom or dad bring up something even vaguely sad or ""deep"", my eyes already start to tear up.

9236,"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

9240,"I started therapy about two months ago. I have had two sessions since then. If you are wondering why I have had so few sessions, its because I am broke, also my therapist sometimes answers my mails too late so by the time she replies she is fully booked.I was able to schedule an appointment from the website where I found her in the first place, then she gave me her mail address so that is what I used to book my previous appointment. But she always answered too late, and one time she did not answer at all. And, you know, whatever, sometimes people forget things or make mistakes. She is not responsible for answering all the mails from her clients during the day they were sent.And then she did not show up. The way this website works, I do not really know if she knows its me, and the website is complete shit so I do not think I will be able to get my money back.I need help. I really need help, I am going to go insane. I have been trying to get help, and I am going to explode from all the thoughts going through my head and my goddamn IBS and all the other bad stuff that is happening that I cannot handle. I have nobody to talk to face to face. I have a friend I made here and we do talk to each other about our struggles but I cannot use her as a therapist, because she is a friend and not a therapist, and she cannot help me in a way a therapist can.So now I lost the money I saved. It will take at least a couple of weeks before I save enough money to see someone again. I have made a document where I talked about my past and all the dark and heavy stuff that happened to me and people I love, and now I have to start over again. I lost progress and I desperately needed progress.Now I will have to save money, find someone else, book an appointment, open up to them about all the dark and heavy stuff again somehow, have another session about all that stuff and what I expect from therapy and how this stuff is going to work, then I will be where I am right now with this therapist.Goddamn I needed progress.

I will keep it really cut and dry (this is years and years of shit, condensed) But I really want to know if I am being too ridiculous or not, because my family seems to think so...&amp;#x200B;If a family friend who lived in your house, with your family, raped you (virgin with a chronic pain disorder), would you ""expect"" your family to defend you? &amp;#x200B;Mine gaslit me and refused to believe me until it was found out years later he gave me vaginal scarring and HPV warts inside of my vaginal canal. I had to show them the proof from the doctor. He works at our family business, and lives on our property still. I have since moved out of town. But I cannot be anywhere near my family or even talk on the phone with them without hearing his name or his voice or the like. &amp;#x200B;I let my father (who runs the business) know that I was working on my case with a detective, so find a replacement truck driver because once he gets interrogated he is getting kicked off the property and fired. That was almost 8 months ago. Two months ago, he was given a polygraph and completely and utterly failed it. he is telling everyone at work that I am a liar and he passed the polygraph with flying colors. My brother is STILL best friends with him and plays video games with him 4+ hours a night almost daily. He works with him. My father refuses to evict him or fire him until he finds a replacement, which has not been working out very well. &amp;#x200B;I have been gaslit my whole life by my family, and have really bad C-PTSD that adds to my chronic pain. My rapist knows/sees this stuff daily, and I guess he decided to join in because he knew my family would not believe me or defend me... but now I am getting REALLY fucked up because I never thought it would go this far. I never thought they would spend years defending my rapist, I never thought that even after PROVING what he did, my family al would allow him to slander me at our family property and business. The PTSD and despair is so intense lately that I cannot pull myself out of it. I get an hour of therapy per week but it is not enough. I have been really screwed up the last several years, but after seeing my family treat me this way... after seeing my own sibling side with my rapist... after he gets to just keep going on like nothing happened.... after he gets to lie and tell everyone he passed his polygraph... after he gets to keep being apart of the family... after my family tries to make me feel guilty for having needs or feelings... I cannot take it anymore. I just cannot. &amp;#x200B;Is it ridiculous of me to expect him to be given a 30-day notice of eviction from our property? Is it evil of me to ask that he be fired so I do not have to hear his name or voice over the phone anymore? Is it fucked of me to feel extremely betrayed that my brother sides with my rapist? (my brother already treated me like shit but I never expected him to do something quite this screwed up. he is been shown proof that I was raped, so it is not just him believing my rapist, he CHOOSES to ignore the proof)... Is it wrong to expect a ""family friend"" that is ""basically a 2nd son"" to my father, to get removed from our family? Is 7+ months long enough time to ""prepare"" to replace him? Am I asking too much? I feel I literally CANNOT move on or continue breathing if I have to have him involved in my life in any way, shape, or form. My only choice has been to stop speaking to my family members. But that does not stop me from suffocating in the toxicity from afar while my family just sits idly by letting him slander me to everyone around them. It does not help me move on. It does not fix anything. I am just secluding myself more and more. I have never asked for anything this selfish in my life, so I feel INSANELY guilty for even asking for it... but I would rather DIE than to keep enduring this, and having this make my chronic pain even worse. I just need him out. I need him gone. &amp;#x200B;I will not even go into even more fucked up details, but he also stalks women around town, and is still a sexual predator, and might possibly have an attraction to children as well given his odd behavior. Unfortunately I cannot go after him for my rape because I did not get a rape kit done (because I knew my family would refuse to drive me at the time, cannot drive myself with my condition. I was terrified and knew the gaslighting would trigger me to kill myself in a heartbeat with how fragile I was). But here I am, years later, still stuck in this crossroads. And now it is even worse. I just want the pain to fucking end. This is way too hard to endure alone as a handi-cap person.&amp;#x200B; Do my feelings seem justified, or am I being ridiculous? I have to ask because my entire life I have been convinced my feelings are always wrong, and I do not think ""normally"" as other people do. So I would like to ask the Reddit community---What do you think a ""normal"" reaction to this situation would be? If something like this was happening to you, what would you do?

9284,"I have dealt with chronic depression from a very young age, I am currently 31yrs old. There have been times in the past where I though I was as bad as I could get. Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be, and I fear I am losing myself entirely. I do not know what I am looking for here, perhaps just a place to speak my peace. Much love reddit, stay strong.

9285,"Hi everyone! I am a lifelong sufferer or generalized anxiety and historically have only has situational depression and as a result I have lots of tools for anxiety but few for depression. The past 2 years I have been suffering from severe depression. Right when i started to feel hopeful I found out I was to be evicted for owner move in. In 1 week I have to leave my home and city that I have called home for the last 20 years. No one is helping me pack or clean and tbh I would probably refuse any that a offered because I would not want anyone to see what has turned into a hoard as a result of my depression. I have been living in squalor. I have a plans and the technical tools i need to execute the cleanup and move but all I have been doing for three days is crying. This eviction is super personal and has forced me to face things about loved ones and myself that i was not prepared to do. The amount of grief, anger, and fear I am feeling is overwhelming and totally paralyzing me. If I cannot get my place cleaned up its going to make my current issues 10 times bigger. I need an off switch, or at least a pause button so I can get what i need done. Are there any tools /strategies that can help me let go of Or at least temporarily stuff these feelings so that I can get what I need to get done?I should note that I am being diligent about basic self-care such as eating, hydrating, and sleeping so you can skip those bits.Any and all tips are very much appreciated, I am drowning over here, thanks.

There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment, I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together.

I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself.

9298,"this is my first reddit post ever. I am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one I have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds I have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. I am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. I am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my ""natural healing"" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?",Depression

Electroshocks (only effect was loosing memory for 3 months), multiple hospitals, various combinations of different pills, therapy, solving issues from my past, selfgrowth, practicing positive thinking (what a joke) and many other things. Guess what! Nothing worked. So I was like okay I really need to try everything before I finally go away from this sick world. So noone can say I did not try. I moved to another country (I am in Europe), I got amazing job (IT field), friends... I have everything. I should be happy right? I even went on vacation for 10 days (small sailing boat in Greece) and returned on start of this month. Everyone is telling me that I will never forget such vacation and that it must have been amazing but... seriously I felt nothing. They say ""wow such an amazing view!"" and I just cannot see it. My illness took everything from me. I cannot feel joy, happiness... only everyday pain. If you wonder what is my diagnosis then officially its schizophrenia. It was explained to me that its only because they can prescribe most existing pills with this as official diagnosis. Other diagnosis are restricted - you cannot get any pill you want/need. So trust me that I tried everything and even brand new pills called Reagila which should have been breakthrough in treating these issues. But during those years every hospital told me something else. I was officially diagnosed with so many things that its really just one big joke. No one wants to admit that they have no idea what is going on and that they just cannot treat this. Maybe in next century right? Well I am not going to wait for that. I mean they allow euthanasia for people who are in pain and their condition is not treatable. So what is the difference bettween those people and me?! I consider myself as rational person but I really do not see what else could I try. I think this is it. I give up. Now I am just able to function with Xanax (basically sedative pill) which is helping a little bit (pain is still there just little less intensive) but that is also not a solution since its addictive and makes you walking zombie. That little lie... I mean hope which I told myself everyday - that everything will pass and I will be able to be happy... its just not real. I am damaged beyond repair.

I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold.

Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool.

I guess I am just asking if I should be truthful or not. Should I tell my sister and brother that the jokes they made killed me a little by little should I tell my parents that a big reason of why I killed myself is because of the things they have done.

9329,"Hello, new account new me, right? As such, I think Id like to let you know that I am a 22 year old bachelors degree holding female. I am college educated in what I am struggling with but that has not helped. I have been dealing with delusions and hallucinations for years. Lack of sleep, follows, of course, and while I am not medicated for these happenings I am well versed on how to.. handle them. At least I thought I was. It all started at work, right? Last Monday, a week from today. I was asked to speak with my supervisor right before she was to leave. She and her boss had written me up. Fine, fine. that is fine. I was fine with it until I realized they were lying about it. I had the proof. Proof somewhere, proof everywhere. Everyone Id told said it was ridiculous. I said it was fine.Until I looked at the proof. That spiraled into getting a binder to hold the proof. A notebook to write down times, a box of paper clips to hold proof together, a box of sticky notes to annotate my work lists and proof. I called off yesterday. I stayed up all night; the tv yelling at me, bugs crawling on me, my husbands itching disturbing me. It was rough, and it happened again last night, I did not get to sleep until 5ish am. But I got up dreading life at around 8am. The people at work are staring at me, my bosses plotting against me, my coworkers talking about me. I cannot handle this.

It really does seem like the best path forward.This past year has been the worst in my life, continuing a constant downtrend and I might be done. Of course it was not all bad. There were definitely some years, even consecutively sometimes, that made me believe that it would turn around, but I now have conclusive proof it will not. About a year ago, I wound up getting diagnosed with something new every couple of months and it looks like I can expect to be in constant pain until I croak. If I let it happen naturally, it will be decades. I still get to live a full length life if I want, but I do not think I want to. there is nothing so good in my life that makes me think sticking around worthwhile.I have good friends, a good job, a healthy social life, but I just do not want to anymore. Is it selfish to want to call it quits, or is it selfish for everyone to want to keep me around even though I do not want to be here?I do not have any immediate plans since those would be rash, but I am going to start planning.

Even though I am trying to work on myself, I am not at a point, where I could just start a relationship without ruining or at least stressing out my partner and it sucks.The other problem is, that I do not even know, what a healthy relationship looks like and the chances are pretty high, that I will let myself get abused because I have not learned, how to spot stuff like this or even worse, unknowingly become an abuser.it is sad to admit but I cannot do this to myself or someone else. Not right now. Sometimes life just sucks. I will still try and work on myself and do what I can but hearing stuff like that...especially because I did not ask for a comment like that.

Her sense of humor is unmatched and remains the only person I have seen literally laugh through pain. Unfortunately, she does not feel the same way and she is beating herself up internally. she is under a lot of pressure both in terms of interpersonal relationships and academic expectations, in addition to all of the weight the world around us inherently puts on her. I am not sure how to help her and when I ask her, she does not know either. I am definitely guilty of having what I have seen described as the typical male urge to fix things and yeah, that is backfired. Ill ask her what can be done on my end but she does not know. Talking about it does not really help her. She ends up feeling stupid or as if she is an inconvenience. There are only so many distractions and they are only effective for so long.

The lymphoma already acommitted my lungs, and breath is turn difficult. The treatment is painful and hard, and I do not want to do it. So I have decided that I am going to face it as far as I can. When it becomes very debilitating, a good dose of nembutal awaits me. A quiet and painless death is a privilege that few people have, mainly, those who have cancer.My grandfather, who once had cancer, said this is a cowardly and selfish choice. But for me, clinging to life as flesh and bone, poisoning your body with chemotherapy, and after that spending the rest of your life taking care of the consequenses that such treatment brings, is a more cowardly and selfish choice than simply accepting your death.I have never wasted my time thinking about suicide, but now it feels like a good ending to me.

Maybe then I would not be drawn to the neutral, conventionally attractive clothing the world tells me I should wear. Maybe then I would not constantly worry about whether my shoes are shiny enough, or of I ironed my blouse enough.Maybe if I had been the better sibling, I would not work 60 hours a week, desperately trying to earn approval from my boss. Maybe I would not feel like I need to be the most accommodating, yet entertaining person whenever I visit home.Maybe if I was not born a woman, I would not feel the need to constantly perform. To be a perfect, daughter, a perfect girlfriend, hopefully to be a perfect wife and mother.

I feel like a Madame Alexander doll, in a perfectly ironed dress, with perfectly coifed hair, and an empty smile, standing idly by my flower arrangement while I silently pray everyone likes the table settings and the food. I love my family, but I hate the voice in my head that nags and criticizes. I will not change. I crave the external validation too much. I love to be complimented on my carefully thought out veneer, knowing how much effort it required. It takes makeup and shapewear to be ingratiated into society, you know. In the meanwhile, I use drugs to numb it. Strong, heavy tinctures that cloud my brain and depress my body. Not so much that I relax my posture, but enough that my muscles can unclench. A trained eye could perhaps perceive, in photos, my glassy eyes, all but overshadowed by eye makeup and bleached teeth. Always dressed up, always smiling, always blank behind the eyes. I want to be a good mother one day, but this makes me question myself. I am my father, before his 10+ years of sobriety.I do not know how long I will live, or if I will die by my own hand. The perfect wife and mother would never off herself. Even dying under mysterious circumstances could bring suspicion. Not only that, but I have made a promise to care for my parents in their old age. Sometimes I wonder if having children would give me something to live for. Another strike against my qualification to be a good mother.I go through the motions, giving my all at work, in my private consulting, in my writing, hopeful that I will one day do something deserving of recognition and praise.

Plus I got sexual dysfunction which in itself was depressing.I am at a stage of my life where I feel like I am better off, compared to before. But I still just get super sad sometimes, without a direct explanation. I was also diagnosed with ocd, because I become very obsessive when in relationships. I have avoided sexual and romantic relationships until I can learn to feel whole single. I have been in multiple abusive relationships before, and always used relationships to fill some sort of void within myself.Now, I am focusing on personal hobbies and career progression. I have a lot of things that bring me joy, things to live for. But those feelings of depression always come back up suddenly. I just feel really sad and empty sometimes.

Maybe that idea was always unrealistic, but I no longer have any belief that I will make it out the pit of depression.

After asking many therapists and being denied as a patient, I give up now.

Of course, people always tell you that it gets better etc etc, but I do not believe the phrases anymore. I got no hope left and wish this suffering would just end.

Over the years, I have been to a therapist (two sessions, she did not help and I cannot afford more lol), did a workshop with a psychologist and been to a psychiatrist (a few months ago, told me I do not need meds but we can revisit it in a few months). I just did a session with another psychologist, and I have just been crying from frustration. It feels like most of my time is spent getting these people to take me seriously. When I tell them about my problems, how I feel so tired of life and fatigued, they just tell me that I am young and I need to not take things seriously, because life is going to get tougher. I am just so sick of the lack of support. I spent most of these sessions telling them more about my symptoms, getting into progressively serious ones, and they just dismiss them. They tell me 'not to think about it', or 'be grateful for what I have'. do not get me wrong, I am grateful, and I already avoid thinking about 'it' to prevent crying, but Id still like to know how to get out of bed in the morning and not want to die. I am at the end of my rope, and done with therapists etc but my mom wants me to see one more. Does anyone else have advice on how to get these professionals to see that you have a serious debilitating problem that is affecting your day to day life, that I am not just going through 'being young', and how to stop them from giving you tough love and give genuine coping strategies? They do not believe me when I say I have actually tried everything (working out somewhat regularly, clean diet, cutting out toxic people and even fucking breathing exercises). Honestly, Id rather take antidepressants and finally take my life off of hold- do not have the time or money for therapy.

9408,"So I started dating someone earlier this year. We hit it off almost immediately after I got out of a mentally abusive relationship (my ex continuously cheated on me and manipulated me anytime Id suspect it). I was not ready to be in a relationship at the time I met my current partner, but they changed my way of thinking by saying love does not have a timeline. Our situation started off rocky as hell, they still talked to their exes on daily bases, which is a boundary I created for myself. They had hearts next to their exs name, and flaked on me when they hung out with them. Had their clothes and belongings still in their home, and anytime Id react and try to leave they would offer to call their ex in front of me, or tell me I could go through their phone. I was not okay with doing so, and I still tried breaking up with them, but they always told me I was self-sabotaging by doing so. Being in a bunch of manipulative and abusive relationships I could not tell if what they were saying was true, or if I was just putting myself through the same cycle. Anyways, we continued dating and our depression does not make anything better. I know that even on my worst days I make effort to talk to them, but it gets tiring knowing that they still make effort to communicate and hangout with their ex while it feels like they are doing the bare minimum for me. We go from hanging out often to barely seeing each-other/talking in week intervals, although I understand the concept of space. It gets confusing knowing the state of our relationship. We work on communication more than anything, but no matter how many times they have said its okay to communicate anything that bothers me to them, it seems like it always goes up in flames and that my perspective is always false. With their depression active the past month, I just asked them for a little initiative when talking to me, its hard feeling like I am the only one who reaches out and knowing their daily routine of waking up, checking their phone, texting people and going on Twitter I feel like I am asking for the bare minimum when I tell them just a simple good morning text would make me feel a little more cared about, but instead they got upset with me saying I do not understand that their depression makes it hard to even get up in the morning . what is frustrating is that I know exactly how they feel because I experience it also. I just want to feel the same amount of effort I am putting out, but maybe I am lacking compassion in this instance? I am sorry for my rant, I am just feeling quite low in this situation.

9420,"I feel like recently I have been having suicidal thoughts rather frequently, I feel like i do not want to be alive currently but at the same time I do not want to give up my life, I feel like life can be so great and amazing but sadly i just cannot enjoy it due to my episodes of depression. I just wish i could be happy that is my only dream in life. Its been especially hard recently because I am going through a very rough depressive episode and during it i unfortunately was forced to cut off my soul mate who was the only person I have truely loved my entire life, she was the only person i could have talked to but now i have no one, I have never posted here before but i just have nowehere else to go.The most sadistic thing about episodes of depression for me is the fact that after one ends i feel like happiness is almost in my hand and i can almost achieve it, I even can feel it for very short periods of time in a rare moment where i seem to forget about reality, and then it just hits me twice as hard. I feel like its a constant repition of one step forward two steps backwards and I just do not know what to do.If anyone reads this thankyou for hearing me out.

9425,So I need help guidance on how to help my brother. So my brother who is 24 broke up with his girlfriend about 4 months ago ever since he has been down hill just about 3 weeks ago he opened up to me. He is a alcoholic drinks every day he is so depressed about his break up and I think that the root of this. He has cut him self multiple times. He drinks hard liquor now just to hide the pain. He tells me he wishes this would just go away. He said ever since he open about his depression and alcoholism to the family he feels more depressed. Today he has a appointment with a psychiatrist also I am trying to get him to go to AA meetings. But idk if I am to late because he is drinking at his job and he is drinking when he gets home. I am afraid he might kill someone and himself. Yesterday he told me that whatever happens happens and that he is not afraid to die. The big problem I see here is that when he is alone at his job a feel he looses the mental battle and seeks alcohol. I am afraid I am to late to help my little brother. Also I feel like my parents just tell him to man up and now I am responsible for him and if something happens to him its on me. I do not want to live with that burden. Idk what to do I could not sleep last night all I thought about was him. I have talked to him multiple times and every time he just breaks down and cries he is willing to seek help but I kind of since he is also suicidal. Idk what to do or what to say my anxiety is threw the roof. Any advice would be appreciated thank you. Need help!!!!,Depression

By the way he is retarded, not officialy diagnosed but I can tell since he does not even know where his country is on the world map... . Since I do not have anyone to talk to, I started to daydream a lot, it is called maladaptive daydreaming and I do it 15 hours everyday, depending on how much I sleep. And also I talk to myself all the time, because like I said I have nobody to talk to. But at the same time I do not want to be with anyone because I took umbrage against the whole society for treating me the way they did and I do not think it is ok for me to be accept anyone in my life even if someone wants to be my friend (Which is impossible).By the way, I have not talked to a female in 7 years.

Just want to die as soon I can. I do not want to keep myself alive. there is no worth to anyone. In my eyes, I am just a waste of resources.

9433,"I have entered what I would probably characterize as the darkest period of my life so far. I am in a job I despise, and I recently started therapy, which has overall been a net positive, but it is also forced me to take a long and hard look at many personal traits of my own that need a A LOT of work. I am realizing I do not have a strong sense of personal identity and that I have a much lengthier and more problematic track record of behaving in toxic and manipulative ways. All-in-all: my opinion of myself is quickly rocketing into the dirt and I am in the midst of the most intense identity crisis I have ever experienced.All of this and a slew of other unpleasant factors have left me feeling like I am heading right for a potentially explosive breakdown. Like, I am about to get married and I love my fiance very much, but making a lifelong commitment like that to another human being when I myself feel like I have no clue who I am, what my values and passions are, or where I am heading in life scares the shit out of me. I have also recently began indulging some self-harm impulses (which are relatively minor and not life-threatening or scarring) for the first time in over a decade which feels like such an enormous step backwards for me. I feel like a rubber band stretched to the brink of snapping and some unknown combination of time and/or additional tension will inevitably make me snap. I do not know what to do about it, because the more I think about the state I am in, the more I feel like I am spiraling out of control. But I also feel like I cannot NOT think about it because ignoring and repressing my problems and my mistakes is how I ended up here in the first place. The worst part is that, even though I can feel the meltdown coming, I feel powerless to stop it. Which is kind of how I would sum up my current crisis: a complete loss of control over my life and the direction it is going in.Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If so, any tips on how to deal with yourself or at least keep yourself from hurting others while your life is unravelling? Even if not, I appreciate having the space to vent. (For the record: I am not presently concerned I am going to kill myself, and I am not worried I am at risk of physically hurting others. But I am worried I am at risk of burning all of my bridges and tanking all my personal and professional relationships into the ground and causing a lot of emotional damage to myself and others on the way.) What do you do when you feel yourself beginning to unravel? Can I at least mitigate the damage my impending breakdown could because others?",Depression

9436,"I was on depression medication bc I was having chest pains at random times. they did the full screening of my body to make sure it was not physically and everything was good. I started them and they were like okay? like it just kind of made me motivated than anything. sexual side effects got to me so now I am only on anxiety, which stops the chest pain but i still get anxious so like, I guess it stopped the terrible chest pain but like I am still anxious, which I guess is normal. I feel like its impossible to be in a relationship when I am like this. I broke up with my girlfriend for a few months like a year ago and I truly felt so good for awhile. maybe even she is weighing on me? Anyways any tips anyone has on how they beat their depression battles? my depression is not like self harm but sometimes think what would happen if I just wrecked my car (even though I never intentionally would), just some bad thoughts that I would not act on, no motivation, distance myself from everyone. for years I hated how skinny I was and when me and my gf broke up I put on some muscle and now I am getting a stomach I absolutely hate seeing, which then I do not put any consistent time into working out which does not help my mind either. I went on a few vacations and that was good to be out of this shitty area. mixed 21 year old in a republican/ racist ass area. like literally seen n word killer and drive by a truck with a black stay back sticker every single day. I am also absolutely terrible about talking about anything. I need out of this but idk how. I feel like last time I got like this I just broke up with my girlfriend and do not want to do that again. i work full time but literally do next to nothing all week which probably is not good for me in any way either. like where does this motivation come from? I want to actually be able to get out and stay out of this headspace. I am like genuinely ever happy just playing PlayStation with my friends/ talking to my friends on there. its the only time I am ever myself (and with gf). its like a big ass disconnect from everything and lifes actually hood.

9437,"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student",Depression

Earlier I sacrificed my career for that my family will benefit if i get a well paying job and me being good at academics I was able to crack the most difficult exams too but then later I realized I am not happy and I do see my self doing this work all my life or even a major chunk of time like 10 years. Now again I am stuck in a really lucrative and secure option but since my mental health is not good because I am not able to see myself happy even after I end up with a good job. I am just becoming a loser again and if i decide to dropout and do what I like doing .i.e. startup, but I fear that if it fails then I will not be able to bounce back at age of 26(yes I am 26 now and I am from South Asia) and I will end up as a failure and loser which I never was, I miss my 15 year old self who was passionate and driven and absolutely acing in everything but now I am a big failure story. So I want to see how guys see this problem from your perspective because I cannot think through and I do not want to trouble my family anymore. So what should I choose, security or what i love doing?

My dad is leaving us next year to go back to his country (as he is separating from my mom), and the idea of me moving out is gone because part of me feels extremely guilty for leaving my mom alone when she does not make enough money. But on the other hand, I know she is extremely homophobic and she even discourages me from making friends too much. I have been really socially deprived as an introvert and I feel like I am missing out because its not like I have a lot of friends. Tbh, I feel suicidal because everything is only getting worse. I feel I might have to break up with my BF because I do not want to drag him anymore. He deserves someone better. he is been really understanding but at this point everything is breaking me apart and I am not sure if I can commit myself to a relationship.My mom always says stuff like , ""Gay people are always getting into trouble and gay people are aids."" My mom is also invasive of my privacy, like on my phone, and my online whereabouts. she is so against me flirting when people younger then me are already in relationships. I have been suicidal before, but at this point, I am becoming suicidal again. Ofcourse, there is other people's situation worse then mines and my heart aches for them. But I cannot even make a simple phone call so easily without being monitored. Even just to call my LDR bf, I have to sneak to the basement just to videocall him around midnight.Sorry this was long and full of tangents. I have no freedom",Suicidal
9448,"Title says it all. Why am I so fucking sad after I go for therapy? Is this normal? My heart hurts. I feel empty and achey and just fucking sad. I am a bike messenger, and sometimes when I am riding, I get so lost in my own head I forget where I am or where I am going until some car blares its horn at me. I do my best to keep a straight face when I am with people but I am fucking sad. I have been trying to exercise it off, biking, swimming, weights. Also been binge eating potato chips while I watch TV. Also been crocheting. I have hung out with friends too.

I do not stop myself from falling further and further down the rabbit hole I just sort of watch myself from outside my body as it happens . I get up every morning and go to work and then after work I just collapse and ball up and just sit there for hours not doing anything . I get up the next morning and do the same thing , so at least I have a routine . I want advice on how to feel for things , motivating myself to do things for me , not relying on others to make me feel okay.

Sometimes Id catch myself thinking of things in the future (like taking my sister to the 2032 Olympics as they are in my country) but then I am like I literally will not even be alive.

My sense of self worth plummets even lower than usual and my mind starts to slowly but surely focus on dark thoughts.

9453,"Some background info first:Our relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. Although that is not a long time, we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment, he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating, he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020, a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it - he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year (which did not help). Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met, he was having a ""good phase"", but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good, others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself, so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him, we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me, which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide, is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and never-ending waves of corona.(These are just a few of his reasons)I know I cannot ""fix"" his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him, but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him, even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively (besides just being supportive, listening, being there for him,...)If anyone has read this far, thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good advice(English is not my first language- so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing) I (W/18) am scared of my boyfriend (M/20) committing su*cide",Depression

Well, after that, their impression is that things got better. I moved back to the dorm, so they do not see me often. They sincerely think I solved my problems. However, the reality could't be more different. I am totally losing it and planning my suicide. In one moment I am researching for suicide methods and in the other my mom calls and I respond with the lies I have prepared - how university is better, how my job is better, how I feel okay.

9461,"Honestly I thought I had my shit together. I was diagnosed in 2018, so I decided to take a break from uni. Got a whole lot better, like I stopped having panic attacks, no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror, no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest, and then I decided it was time for to continue uni, and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me, the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100% online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an ""outsider"" and ""temporary"", yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning, I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student, and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience, and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower, before I sleep, and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed, make so little progress for work, and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 1/10 of our minimum wage, and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online, so its basically unpaid internship. If any of you are beaten down so bad by your surroundings to the point of depression, I understand. I have supportive friends and I can barely go through this shit. If I faced this alone, I am pretty sure I would have disappeared to a neighbouring town and change my identity, and made sure no one will ever hear from me again.

9485,"Hey, everyone. First off, I will start by saying that this is my first post here, so do please let me know if I have broken any rules with it.Secondly, to give some context (and to also let off some steam), I am pretty sure I have been depressed one way or another for a very long time now. I have never been diagnosed by-the-book, but every therapist I have seen so far has pretty much let me know that it is there. From what I have read and discussed with them, my best guess is that I have something related to dysthymia, although I would say I am generally pretty functional - it is like having an autopilot which allows me to go through the daily routine while being miserable and hopeless (there is no official diagnosis because the therapists I have seen do not like applying labels and have not considered it severe enough to recommend a psychiatric evaluation).I occasionally get an episode which is worse than the norm. I mostly always feel a sense of generalised hopelessness and sadness, but the episodes feel like I am thrown down a bottomless pit of despair. I am currently going through one of these episodes as a result of recently having done a sum-up of my life during the past few years.My problem right now, and the reason why I post this here, is that I feel that my support group, my few close friends to whom I have only relatively recently started opening up about this, have started trying to persuade me that my depression's incorrect, somehow. I have been thinking pretty much all day that maybe I am just too sensitive at this particular point in time and maybe I am reading too much into it, but I keep feeling minimised and invalidated when talking to them (stuff like ""you have an incorrect view of yourself,"" ""you are being overly-dramatic,"" ""I am sure things are not as bad as you see them,"" ""maybe you have some form of dissociative disorder"" - this last one came straight out of left field, since all of the therapists I have seen so far have, at one point or another, remarked my fervent insistence on keeping facts and reality as straight as I possibly could). All of these just... hurt, especially knowing my history of deep-diving into my thoughts and realising that most points which because me my unrest are conclusions drawn according to objectively negative and damaging experiences from throughout my life.do not get me wrong, I know depression does not really allow for objective perspectives, even less so during an intense episode, but everything they say just makes me feel like they are not even trying to take it seriously, even for a second.they are currently insisting that I join them for a group call to discuss ""magical realism"" (an attempt at a joke, I assume), but I really do not feel like that kind of invalidation and minimisation's what I need right now. My question, thus, is how do I deal with this? Am I taking things too personally, is this entire thing just another element of my episode? If not, how could I politely explain this to them without them having a knee-jerk reaction? I am honestly reticent to broach the subject because I expect they will lean even harder onto that ""incorrect perception"" of mine and I really do not want to upset them more than I clearly am doing with my episode. Hard enough to open up about it in the first place... Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that, and thank you in advance for any advice you could offer.

9504,"Hello everyone,I rarely post on Reddit but.....I have nowhere else to go. I have talked to my selected friends but all your inputs are important. I would like to warn everyone this may have religious talks and depression....yeah....like that.....I have a bestfriend of 20 years. This year she will be getting married to the love of her life. I am genuinely happy for her. I really am. Here is the story: My bestfriend got engaged last January 1. She is currently living in United Kingdom, have a wonderful job and loving Fiance. After the engagement, she told us and her closest friends and family that they will wed next year July of 2022. So I was really ecstatic of hearing such wonderful news, at last she will settle down and create a family of her own. She told me that she wants me and our other bestfriend to be there at her wedding, we are three. we have been bestfriends since High School. I got fired up to save a lot of money for plane ticket and pocket money to be with her on her special day. Since I live in Asia, and the cost when you go to UK will cost a lot since our salary here is like x10 lower than what people earn in the western countries.&amp;#x200B;Til one time, she suddenly asked me if I could ask my Uncle who is a priest if Cohabitation is a sin. I asked her like why? She told me she and her Fiance wants to live together, because living in separate houses traveling back and forth every weekend is very tiring for the both of them. I told her if they want to live together without tying the knot yet is not a big deal. If that will help save them gas and transportation allowance, then go. But she told me she is looking for answers and admitted they are in abstinence from sex for how many months now. She felt guilt doing pre-marital sex, and she always seeks answers from God. Asking for signs and that. There is nothing wrong with that, I am a religious person myself but I do what I do. I know my limits. We have this saying in our country: ""God have mercy on us, man has their doing."" When I talked to my Uncle who is a priest and asked him about Cohabitation, he just straightly answered that: Cohabitation is a sin. And I told my bestfriend about it and she contemplated about it. And I know she is been asking a lot of people and even religious leaders in her country. And most of them told her there is nothing wrong if they want to live together. She is still reluctant. And fighting her Anxieties over the matter. To the point that we raised our voice at each other during a video call, because she told me that my life become shitty because of karma, because I lived with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. It was a really big stab in my heart, and I cried but I dismiss what I felt and I still prioritize her because I know she is more vulnerable than I am. Fast forward.......I do not remember if when she did announce that they decided to wed this year. I was surprised and partly disappointed because the first thing that I thought was that I will never see her walking down the aisle in person, and partly I know the reason for the sudden shift. But it was only a short span of time because I understand that she wants to live in peace with the blessing of God. I just express how surprised I am, and I told her I am happy for her at last she will be settling with the man of her dreams.They will have a small wedding this year, and a big wedding next year which in the same month of July 2022.But as the months go on, she always asks me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look dissapointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy?* I always answer her: *People will be surprised of course, because you told them that your wedding is next year and there is a sudden change but that does not mean that they are not happy. do not ever think that.* I know it is her Anxiety talking. I deeply understand, because I also have one I have had depression and Anxiety for how many years. I always put myself in her shoes. Ever our other bestfriend she always asks about it, and she just answers: *It is you and your Fiance who will be getting married, not us, not other people. Only the two of you will create your own Happiness.*I also answer the same thing everytime she asked about it. Until I do not know what to say anymore, I asked my therapist and friends who got married about it. And they say: *Tell her that it is only her that will create her own happiness, not everyone else. But we know Anxiety is a big enemy.*My bestfriend become so anxious as months passed by and at some point became bitchy. Her patience shortened and at one point she is very angry? because the Bishop is not responding through her email, and she even told me if within 2 weeks he does not reply that is it. She will find another one. I told her that she is not the only person who will get married, there is also plenty of couples who wants to wed. And because of pandemic the rules and schedules have changed, she has to understand it. And she was like: *Is this what God wants?*So after a few more weeks, she decided to transfer to another Parish, and to her surprise there are schedules for weddings, the Parish Priest told her that he is available in 2 weeks time they could wed if they want to soon. And she was shocked at how fast it is. And I told her: *There ya go, no worries in finding a Priest and you have a schedule.* And she answered me: *It is too fast and too much.*The priest asked them if they have a venue already? Catering services? Photographer? And others? and they plainly answer: *No, we do not have anything yet.*The official Schedule of her wedding is by September 18 this year. She became more anxious. I understand what they called wedding Jitters. And she still ask me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look disappointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy? Why is it like that?*Last Friday we had that conversation again, and I told her do you want to know the Truth? I can give you answers but you have to be ready. So, I told her that the possibility is that people see it as desperation, lack of security, insecurity, something like that. And I remind her that one time when one of her co-workers commented that is she afraid to lose her Fiance something like that. And then the word **Desperation** struck her. And she asked me is that also what you think of me and \[our other bestfriends name\], is that it? And I plainly answered her: *No.* And there is another question. Were you disappointed when we announced that we are getting married this year? Tell me the Truth. I do not know what I was thinking that time but I told her the Truth that I was a bit disappointed like 50% but it was for a short time. And I am passed by it. It was a very long time ago for me, and all I am focused on is I want her to walk down the aisle. And even volunteered to process her needed papers here in our country.She told me that she was very disappointed in me because she was not expecting that of me. So all this time I was not genuinely happy for her like all of it is fake. I told her it was not, I actually felt guilty that time, that is why I want to make it up to her by helping her with what I could give. She even asked me if our other bestfriend felt the same way and I told her it is not in my position to answer on her behalf. She told me on chat that her friend in UK was so genuinely happy when she asked her if she could be her bridesmaid. And she told me it is better for me to take care of things alone knowing that people are genuinely happy rather than people helping me(which she is pertaining to me) not genuinely happy. I want to justify myself more, but she just answered **WHATEVER.** So I did not push any further, I decided that I just have to let her cooldown, I know she is very stressed out.&amp;#x200B;I contacted our other bestfriend and she called me and we talked a lot via messenger and during that time she is talking to our bestfriend in UK. She is a Teacher here in our country and her patience is kind of running out, but we have to remind ourselves that it is her Anxiety talking right now and we know she will not listen even to us. But my bestfriend kind of admitted to her that what I said about desperation kind of struck her, and somehow she thinks it is true. Perhaps?I decided to mute all my chats in Messenger because I need some time alone. And just played online games, talking to different people to shift my impending Anxiety again of what has happened. I feel like I am terrible bestfriend for that. I am also dealing with a lot of Shit in my life. But for me I have to prioritize her wellbeing. She needs me, and my other bestfriend more than ever. When I talked to my former boss turned male bestfriend I told him what happened, and what I like about his advice is that I am correct at some point but I should have told my bestfriend a **WHITE LIE. Even if she forced me to tell the truth about how I feel.** She seeks positivity and assurance. And I am the only person and my other bestfriend who can give her assurance for that. I learned for that matter more.I am just worried about her, because she is snapping a lot. Not just about the wedding but at her work as well. We told her to breathe. Last time she got extremely mad at her Fiance, because of a simple comment about the flowers. And she was like: *Who will walk down the aisle? Who is the bride? And our wedding is this year! Not next year!* And her Fiance was so afraid whenever she gets mad. That he waited outside her apartment for them to be okay. But my bestfriend just ignored her. But they made up, do not worry. Her Fiance just wants to know, what is their plan? And she admitted that we really do not have one. I told her you two to have to sit down and talk. Listen to what he says. You easily snap.At least they are okay now. And she found a beautiful wedding gown. Which is really really beautiful. But I still do not read her last message because I am thinking I might have to justify myself. Even my other bestfriend is also stressed out and worried that she always burst, she always explodes. She never cools down. I shared our predicament with my married friends and they told me wedding stress is normal, but not that much. Because they balanced things out and talk about it as a couple. I understand my bestfriend wants acceptance. She wants a wedding where everyone is happy around her not just her. She wants to be like that.....Even we told her plenty of times that other people's opinion does not matter. What is important is that they love each other.....but.....she will still ask the same question.....&amp;#x200B;I really do not know what to say. I feel like a bad person telling her how I felt before. I am sorry if this is kind of rollercoaster and long........I am just really worried. It is very hard to talk to someone with a closed-mind right now. Thank you for reading everyone. I feel like a bad person",Depression

9520,"Really struggling. I do not know where to begin..I have always had challenges. I have now been diagnosed with Bpd, which come with a bunch of friends; depression, ocd, attention deficit. Up until two years ago I was bumping through life, but then I lost my job, lost my house and was abandoned again! I have been trying to rebuild ever since. I tried to start training for an alternative career, then the pandemic hit. Back in June 2019 I was the closest I have ever been to taking my life. I made a promise to myself that I would wait at least one year to see if things improve. They are now worse than ever, two years on. I wished I had ended it then at least I would not have had to have lived through the suffering of the last 2 years. I am paralyzed by fear. But... I kept going, because that all I know. I re-trained into a different area, but am petrified to take the next step. I graduated with As. I have always had the security of being employed before - not doing it on my own. I would be dead already if I was not riddled with the guilt which it will leave on others. I just want to sleep forever, I cannot handle being in my own skin. I have tied to get help but have had very little, success. My last relationship has not been a good, I have just not wanted to leave because then I will have nothing. I just do not know where to turn. Professionals do not help. I have stopped talking to friends through fear of being blackmailed by my partner, who has threatened to call my parents in another country and send emails to my friends divulging very personal information.I live in constant fear and misery. For three weeks I have filled out diary cards. I have had one day, where I felt joy briefly 1 out of 10. This is no way for a human to live. every night I prey I will not wake up the next day.. everyday I wake up with a massive gasp of anxiety and affliction - as I once again reform the miserable predicaments, which are my life and know I cannot change it because I am flawed.

Now I just wish I was not alive because I hate the pain I live with every day. What happens when we die? I think nothing - its like when were sleeping except there are no dreams. I am scared of the moments leading up to death, but once I am actually dead, it will not matter because I will not know. I do not think I could kill myself because I cannot imagine the pain Id because on my mom.

9522,"Tw: idk which ones to put but I feel like I should mention that there might be triggers in here.I have dealt with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something.

I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us.

All refer me to mental health professionals that are too busy to call me back or they do not even bother referring me bc the waiting list is too long.

9524,"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home.It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation.Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist. There are days when it just feels like everything is shit, but I just push through. ***\[MODS: I am hoping that this is within the rules. I just needed to get this posted to keep being able to talk about that moment. Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit, and if there is one that would be more appropriate.

9526,"I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester, I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now, I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth $9,000. Also, I can only submit this repeal once, so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip (to put it lightly) in depression.

9527,"I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup, to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them, but when I was on them I was carefree, risk-taking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married, was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 24-28, I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know, with every dose, I was screwing my brain up. With ever-increasing dosages, my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them - after 3 1/2 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening, neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later, I am at a lower dose (.5mg). I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress, but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin, I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity, my will to continue and my confidence for the future. I do not know what to think anymore. So very confused",Depression

9556,"I have struggled long and hard with depression and anxiety since I was 17. I spent years in therapy learning to work with it and my battle hit its peak in Mar 2019. I have an extensive list of mental illness diagnoses (Depression, Panic Disorder, OCD, Eating Disorder, Complex Trauma) and I have tried almost every form of treatment out there.At my lowest point, I started having multiple panic attacks everyday. I started not being able to commute to work or focus during meetings and I was highly encouraged by my medical team to quit my job after a couple of months into my first position as a fresh graduate. I was the only university graduate of my family and my wide-ranging experiences from juggling work and study placed me in a position where I was the highest earning member of my household. My family struggled with finances while I was growing up because my mother was the sole bread winner after my parents divorced and I always had to make the most practical decisions, even when we had to move from house to house because we could not afford to pay for utilities. One of my close family members was also facing trial for a legal implication at that point and we knew our finances were tight. So even the idea of having to leave my job made no sense at all and it seemed like such an out-of-character move for me. I cried and cried, and negotiated and compromised (because I still had student loans to pay off) but I could not avoid the growing emotional debt that I owed myself. Leaving felt like the biggest failure of all and I dealt with a lot of arguments and apprehension, but I did it. I re-scaled my budget, reviewed my expenses, modified my lifestyle and I made it work. Fast forward a couple of months into intensive treatment, I received my childhood trauma diagnosis and the battle of inner conflict ensued. It took me a really, really long time to process all the violence, sexual assault, emotional abuse, manipulation and blackmail from the past 2 decades of my lifetime. And because I dealt with so much pain and struggle, I was hospitalised for an attempted suicide in Dec 2020. I felt like I just did not want to be a part of this life anymore and I just really wanted a way out (I still cry when I think about this). I survived and it felt like such a burden back then and I did not know how to process all of it, but I started learning how to set boundaries and I let people go. I gave myself time, and I told myself that if I was going to live, it would be on my terms. I gradually started working from home for one of my previous bosses after I rested and once my finances were strong enough, I moved out of my familys house (which spurred another round of conflict and guilt-tripping) with my sister and our cat, and I swear that was the best decision I have ever made.Fast forward to today, I finally spoke to my boss (who has been extremely patient and understanding about my mental health situation) and we have agreed that I can gradually start moving back to working full-time with the adjusted pay and benefits to suit. I do not share the full details of my story because there is still a lot of guilt and sensitivity about it. But at my lowest, when I was posting on forums about leaving my job and about my mental illnesses, someone commented on my post saying that he/ she was in the same position once and chose to keep working, but ended up not being able to work permanently because of his/her conditions and encouraged me to take better care of myself. I probably would not have been alive if it was not for that comment. So if anyone needs a sign today, this is it. Leave your job if that is what you need. Take care of yourself and just give life one more try. Its not easy, and if I am being honest there are still days that I wished I did not survive, but not today. Today, I am grateful If you need a sign to put yourself first, this is it. (TW: Suicide)",Depression

9569,"Went on a long walk after work. Lockdown has been going on for months. My evening walks keep me sane. The air smells terrible though.The job promotion feels more like a humiliation. Seems like I am only worth peanuts. I need to get out, but it is not like I am going to get a better job. At least my current work environment is nice. Every day, I oscillate between gratitude for the things I have during a pandemic, and anger at the futility of it all. I can barely afford to buy a place - will have to work another 20-30 years to pay off the mortgage for a shoebox in the air. Even starting a family is tough. I think I am going childfree. Money, money, money. I am working 2 jobs now, not because I am short of money, but having some extra cash, no matter how little, gives me more security. I am trying not to spiral. Maybe I need more sleep. And I need something else to focus on, a passion that could turn into a career. I did some research on grad programs and basically gave up because I am not ready to spend that money. My savings will be wiped out just to fund one degree. Even if I want to, the programs are too competitive, and does not guarantee employment or decent pay after graduation. One of my friends graduated from the field, and I witnessed the difficulty of securing even an internship position. Sorry for the brain dump. I needed to get this off my chest. Trying not to spiral. Even a job promotion does not help",Depression

Why are you such a fucking wimp? Why?I normally end up screaming internally inside my bed. I used to cry myself to sleep, but now there are not any tears left. I sing myself songs of my childhood.

While still on Zoloft I still felt the same and for some reason in my senior year I completely stopped going to school and ended up dropping out, mom was not too proud of that. All I did all day was play video games smoke weed and work at a fast food restaurant.

I have contemplated suicide so often it no longer makes me sad and I am trying to find the absolute easiest and painless method on doing so.

I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is, and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context, me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another, but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat (that I have been gone from since that day) It was her birthday, and she asked if I could go along with said friend, who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday, of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before, and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable, and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable, the whole day I was falling apart, and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day, I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend, I could not do it, and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel, that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself, I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it.

They do not work, you can never really talk about your true problems and even if you could they do not have solutions. Really does seem like the only purpose of them is to get you going another day or for you to incriminate yourself. I grew up poor, with a black immigrant single mother (and a white father). I worked to not fall into their trap getting an education. Where I was constantly berated for not acting like a black stereotype. growing up in a neighbourhood where being a drug dealer was equal in respect to being a banker. worked my arse off to not end up as a chav. got myself into a world class university studying a highly respected field (or so I thought). Hated every day of it but I persevered. so many times I wanted to drop out or end my life, might have even done so if I did not get a decent grade. but I got through it, the loneliness, the boredom, the racial abuse. I left with a master's degree. Now I am stuck in a job where I do not get to use any of those skills. Graduated 5 years ago so I cannot even get a job in my field of study. Seeing drop outs and convicts still serving half their prison sentence in the community making more than me working manual labour. while I am here getting fat making pennies working in front a computer. cannot even move jobs because I would just have to work in the same field but somewhere else. I made sacrifices for my education and to be on the 'right' path. my girlfriend left me and 8 years on still cannot find anyone like her. Because I am mixed race I get discriminated by girls I like. Stuck in a dead end job - dead end for me because I do not want to progress these soft skills I use. Before lockdown I made so much progress in the gym even kept it up during lockdown until I had to start thinking about moving up in my career. Now I have to sacrifice many hours of my free time relearning shit I knew when I was a fresh graduate while the other goals I was working on just atrophy.

I have no privacy because I am always bombarded with responsibility to watch a child even when the mother is available, I have basically become his mother and have raised him and potty trained him because his mother is too lazy to do it herself and instead she gets stoned with her boyfriend. i ask for money to do basic things like laundry and it always ends up being someone else's laundry money, have not had clean clothes in months. at first she spoiled me and buttered me up telling me to be comfortable and that it is my house too but now she treats me like a squatter even though I am responsible for the house being bearable to be in and not a fucking pigsty. i literally put my life on hold to helpher and now she kicks me out and calls me ungrateful for being upset and asking why I am ""sad"" . I AM CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AND HAVE GONE UNDIAGNOSED WITH ADHD FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE madam!!!!! I HAVE NO FRIENDS OR OUTSIDE CONTACT AND EVERY DAY IS THE SAME MONOTONY AND DISREGARD FOR MY EFFORTS.

I take melatonin to make me sleep, But with it I have nightmares and all in all seem to not get a break. My sleep schedule has been extremely messed up but in my own sense its peaceful. I stay awake on my phone or computer till around 7 am let us say? And only then can I fall asleep on my own because my body is so exhausted. This ends up having me sleep till 5 pm at night so I end up not sleeping during the night and sleeping to much into the day. As much as this helped me sleep better I know It is not healthy and it really does not do well for my depression because to me it is, oh it is dark outside might as well stay in and waste my life away more. But if I put my phone down at a normal time my mind runs wild. And it is a very very scary place. This part is why I have came to this group to share. Whenever I over think late at night or let my brain carry on with it is thoughts it seems as if all my consequences go out the window. Like I am numb and nothing matters. there is been so many times all the reasons I am still here did not mean anything to me.

9629,"So in my own (subjective) case, I would say it is a fight in and of itself just to recognise that you happen to be feeling the way you are feeling/thinking along the lines you are thinking because you are in a low swing and your entire perception of reality, let alone your judgement, is impaired.My brain has a habit of convincing me that something else is responsible; which usually ends up with me doing something radical like moving house, or even country, or just generally running from a problem I have assigned some imaginary responsibility to for what is, ultimately, probably just a chemical imbalance in my head.*Anyway* what I wanted to ask you guys is, when you get over that first hurdle and manage to sit down and concede ""I am experiencing a depressive mood swing."" How do you deal with it? It does not seem like something you can fight or attempt to deny, yet wallowing is counter-productive.Winston Churchill called it a ""Black Dog"" and I have read that it is useful to think of depression that way - some animal we have to cow or master, but I guess I am wondering more about techniques/your own experiences here?I can say that writing this was certainly helpful, so perhaps it does just come down to being able to articulate the problem?

My other friend (let us name him P) reach out to our friend group and said J has been ghosting us. Which is true, J has been rarely responding us even tho we reach out him. He said hes been overthinking a lot, his anxiety has been rising, and he needs time alone. Cut off from social media and everything. I understand and comply with his wish.However, there is something that is been bothering me with what P said. P suggests we should distance him, and show disappointment and negative emotions towards him. P believes that if we comply with him, it will only make him take granted for what we are doing and become selfish. Basically what P wants is that he wants J to know his behavior are cowardly and disrespectful to people around him, and that he should not ghost, rather confront us.I do not know what to do. Should we just leave him alone and let him figure it out. Or we make him learn that he should not ghost, but by harsh approach. Taking initiative and confronting him is also possible, but I do not know the right timing. If you have any other approaches, Ill gratefully listen to it.

9642,"I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

The thing about the violin is that its all in the discipline if I need to get better and that is what I find challenging. I hate playing it in the first place with all these deadlines but I have to do it to get good extra curricular marks. Then I realize the last 2 years were all messed up because of this violin. I want to quit but my parents will say that I would be giving up something which I can do but just do not have the discipline to become better. So now I am at a crossroads.

9662,"I am such a retarded fuck up, you know what I am tired of hearing? I am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. Not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not **need** to **artificially** boost yourself esteem. Because you **are** capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a social-able human. You know how fucked my self-esteem is? Sometimes, well actually, most of the time, I hate having a fucking shower because I hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. Despite being told by some that I am too skinny, or that I am normal, etc etc. I still feel and I still am a fat fucking retarded loser. I do pretty decent at school, I got an estimated ATAR of \~84 for Year 12. I wanted to be a pilot in the RAAF, but how the fuck am I ever going to achieve that if I am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. I can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine; but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, I just cannot. I literally want to kill myself as an escape. I remember early 2019 (I think), I was plus-oned (since I never get invited to parties, not even my own friends') to a girl's party who I somewhat had a crush on (if you would even call it that, I do not think I had ever spoken to her, even to this day). Being the socially inept fuckwit that I am, I practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. Eventually I was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. You want to know what I was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? I thought about I could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that I would knock myself out and drown, or how I wish, how I begged that I had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. I eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where I was going, or that they did not want me to leave. Staying at that party would have done far more harm then good I estimate, in fact I **know** it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then I already was going to be as I walked home. Why cannot I just be normal like everyone else, is it because I am an only child who spent 90% of his childhood staring at the wall or watching TV on his own because no one was ever home? Is it because I was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by self-esteem? Or was it that time in 2019 when I got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? (I was already a social anxiety-having fucking retard back then.) Holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. Do I have asperges? I do not fucking know. Do I have social anxiety? I do not know. Am I just shy? I do not know. Do I have depression? I do not know. I hope I do not but I kind of hope I do at the same time so I have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. All I know is that I have fantasized about killing myself since I was a 10 year old, and NoFap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly I just want to kill myself. How bad I just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this Earth. On that note, I am not like most people who say they have ""Given up on humanity"" and how they are ""turning their back on humanity"". Because I am not angry at society or humanity, I know I am the issue, I am the defect. I am so lonely and I love this solace, this hole that I am in, this melancholy. It feels warm, cozy, it feels like I belong here and it feels like I am here to stay. I do not give a fuck anymore, I just want to die. Maybe I will regret it when I do kill myself one day. I am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. Sometimes when I get mad at myself or I feel stress, I just like to rant in my head how I am so much a fucking fat little cunt f\*ggot fucking loser, it feels good. Sometimes I like to pretend I am holding a gun to my head (or in my mouth) with my hand and just pretend I am pulling the trigger and that I will not be here anymore. I remember when I was a little younger, I used to go sleep, making a prayer (Eastern Orthodox) and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. I am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, I apologise. I just wish I could be normal, I wish I did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. I wish I could look people in the eye while I talk to them. I wish I could talk to people. I wish I could talk to girls, I wish I could feel **not** lonely. I have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where I started. 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Just read that, kind of liked how I brought it full circle. I know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. Sure maybe it might, but I do not want to have to try man, I am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. I do not want to try, I just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. Some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' Do you really think I care about being another statistic? If I had a gun, I would have already killed myself lmao. I would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, I do not fucking know. I am listening to some Radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. I will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? How are people arrogant or become overconfident? I want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. Anyways, that is all I can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. Comment what you guys think or something so I know my block of text did not go unnoticed. Or even advice, I dunno, I have not **totally** given up yet. Thanks guys. Self Esteem - Kind of just listing things to get off my chest",Depression

9670,"After years and years of people's bullshit, I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying, constantly being ignored or belittled, constantly being seen as not important, stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet. Usually people say I am grumpy, or I have anger issues. They usually say I need to be a happier person and be nice to others. Well to them, MASSIVE FUCK YOU . I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong, it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat, my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow, everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that. Instead I just reside to my own thoughts and being my own parent and comfort myself that others failed to show. that is why I hate being happy and that is why I refuse to give happiness to others when over the years all I got was hate and bullshit and disloyalty.

9671,"HeyI think this is going to be sort of long but I need someone who does not know me personally to read my thoughts and give me advice on a few things.The first is that I think my views on society and even myself are getting changed by my friend. I am not going to get into detail as to what type of views, its not important, but I think because I have such a big need to get along with everyone and not upset anyone that I sort of just go along with whatever. The second, possibly bigger problem, is that the person I am dating, once straight and heterosexual, recently told me they are non binary. While that itself is not a problem, I am straight and I feel like its not fair to either of us to stay, but they make me feel like I have to. They always feel suicidal and I do not know what they would do if I left them. It makes me feel like a shitty person and I do not know what to do.Another problem is I am religious, I believe in God, but some of my closer friends and the person I am dating does not. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes and I do not like what the talk about sometimes. Of course, I keep my mouth shut but it makes me feel worse in the end.Yet another thing I am having problems with is figuring out who I am, Id there is any purpose of my existence in this Earth. I do not know what I want to do, I do not know what I am going to do. I just graduated high school and I am going to college.

I have my own home and a job and such a great kid, like I am baffled at how amazing she has become.But I am tired, in every way, in every level and in every depth possible. I have a job that kills me mentally and emotionally and my daughters dad (who I am not with) makes my life difficult.The place where I work makes me cry on the way to my shift, during my shift when I am alone upstairs for lunch and I reached breaking point and cried during my shift to my deputy manager because I felt they was on my case all day. But I did not admit that working there makes me suicidal... I mean how can I? I decreased my hours at work 7 months ago as I was struggling so much with juggling the shifts and childcare, and I went on depression meds. I thought it would get better, but it has not. No change of hours has changed the fact that make me miserable. I tried and failed.My daughters dad, well can be a good dad, but picks and chooses when he wants to be. I have to travel up to 4 buses a day every two weeks to get my kid to her dads (as I do not drive) and back and the same again on the Sunday. At times I have to call other family members to do it for me as sometimes I am too exhausted to do it (especially after a fulls day work) and on the odd occasion he brings her back for me on Sunday or picks her up from a family members house but never actually from her school because he works and all that crap as if I do not. And when he does have her, he does not even take care of her, his mum does. he is in his room on xbox, at work or at football or seeing his girlfriend. Because he has a life and I do not as you can see.There is a lot more about why work and my daughters dad makes me miserable but its both long stories.The tipping point is work asking me to come in or to find other people to look after my kid if my child is off school isolating. I am a single parent and my work place keep asking me to palm my kid off to other members of my family or whoever while she is supposed to be isolating so I can work. They know all my family members work, they know my mum has COPD, they know one of my brothers kids (my nephew) has an autoimmune disease, and they now know that my daughters nannie ( dads mum) looks after 2 disabled kids.

Yes.I have finally rang my doctors to get an appointment for a sick note and I will hopefully find the courage to write up a resignation to give to my workplace too.Will I find another job?

9688,"This is what they call a scapegoat personality. My father was one too. He was murdered and his whole estate was claimed by the government as ""proceeds of crime"" (innaccurate) - he was a multiple legitimate business owner/workaholic in the 2000s. It was by corrupt police that did not want him bringing information forward about them at his appeal. His confiscated assets were in the millions and years later I was told he was tortured to death in the desert two States over(right before his appeal date). He died before being able to show his innocence/expose the corrupt cops trying to extort him and regain his work and assets. He essentially worked his whole life from 4am until sometimes 12am (so all day/night and then some)at two different busy and lucrative legit businesses and provided employment to others not just for nothing, but to be spat back at in the face by all of them. As well as miss out on his own and his kids lives.I have been physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by my other parent as a child and every partner I have ever had (it never happened until they had me in a place where I could not go back or escape or when there were not witnesses). I tried to buy a house with my current partner just for him to use me as a stepping stone ""use"" being the keyword and everyone else has shut me out. I have not been in contact with my old friends or remaining family AT ALL for the past two years. My siblings are messed up by our parents but are Unhealthily codependent on our mom and scapegoat me in an unnecessarily psycho way as a display of ""standing up for mom"" or you could say rage denying that she was abusive af as long as it was not being directed at them... Cool.My partner since I was 21uses me to run around for his drug habit and would force me to do the deals while abusing me out of jealousy for the people I had to speak to to get him his drugs but he will not sort it out himself or help me. And he also then threatens to turn me in to the cops as blackmail for doing his drug deals when he feels like sneering down at me or is being abusive. he is also scary af and unpredictable (or should I say predictably abusive) when he does not get his drugs. He takes my house keys off me and kicks me out (I am part owners of the house not even sure if that is legal i told people this and no one cares he just says I am a drug dealer and they think he has a legit reason lol) and I have no one and no where to go. I just did a job trial and an educational course for the last two weeks which was government funded (same government that took my dads whole life away) the teachers were hella old and out of touch but ready to jump down your throat as if we are all feminist militant vegans ready to complain about anything and so this course went 14 days we did fuck all real learning and played games like hangman and they gave us ALL the answers to the assessments. all of them. It was a waste of time and a joke and probably a total of 15 minutes practical experience on a forklift which was the main reason most of us signed up to the course. They cut the course short and have not even booked an instructor/assessor so fuck knows if we are even getting qualified after that bs. My job trial on the last day the boss made some weird comment about my CV saying ""everyone lies on here"" (I think that is what I heard?) Nothing on my resume is a lie and even if it was there is no way they could or should know that they just did not trust me and had something weird in their head about me from the start. Not sure if they know my last name as same industry my dad was cleaning up in 15 years ago and they love shitting all over someone they were once jealous of. He was dyslexic and left school at 14 but just charging every day.I got ghosted by them but idc that much if I did. I almost prefer that to someone scapegoating me for something I have not done to make money, again. Forgot to mention I was really anxious bc I was told I could not take the day off the Forklift course the day of my job trial and I nearly cried multiple times sitting in class while they played hangman no joke and a legit crackhead on meth got to come back from the last class of students to take up our teachers attention the whole day while she sat at his desk and he essentially did her assessments for her. She was not trying man she probably did not even come to class during her course and she got special treatment to come back and pass. At one point teacher made an example of me in front of the class for giggling politely at the person next to me joke about might as well go home instead of play hangman... As if I needed to be taught a lesson in front of the class and this methhead chick while he ignored our class all day to help her cheat. I really want to complain to my employment agency who set me up with this course as we left at least two hours early each day and I am pretty sure they were funding this. If I did not waste my time going the last day I might have been better prepared and successful with my job trial if I had not been stuck there having anxiety and playing hangman while we watched the teacher pass a bad attitude chick on meth the whole day. I find when you are a scapegoat personality what you do does not actually matter. They will bend over backwards to block and cheapshot you while they help people who do not challenge them, their position, or their intellect in any way. ""The identified patient""",Suicidal

My friends are suggesting I take Adderall to reduce the effects of being hungover. What happens if you take all 3? And what happens if you just take Wellbutrin and alcohol? Any advice?

I am freaking terrified all the time this is killing me maybe I am just going to beat it to it take back control once and for all.

9691,"I wish I could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all I really want in this life is to just be loved. To have someone who can actually touch me, most times I associate that with romance. &amp;#x200B;But it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. The last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. The nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. How sad is it that I remember that after 3 months?!&amp;#x200B;That was the only physical contact I have had in nearly 3 YEARS and you wonder why I am constantly thinking about suicide? Is it not obvious?&amp;#x200B;I just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. But it is too much to ask and I know it is. I cannot do ""slow"". Not only have I been cut off from physical contact, I have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. &amp;#x200B;I do not know anyone where I live, I only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. Seeing as how I am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. &amp;#x200B;I frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because I am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. But if I do not cook, then we do not eat. If I do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. &amp;#x200B;Seems every day is just the same. Wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all I can muster. &amp;#x200B;This life has taken so much from me and all I have ever asked for was love. I have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love.&amp;#x200B;It was a nice ideal while it lasted, I suppose. Because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. You got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things.&amp;#x200B;And yet, even as I have grown older, I still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999% of it is completely and entirely useless. &amp;#x200B;Just basic stuff, you know? Like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a TV, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. You could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. &amp;#x200B;How ironic, I suppose. I try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, I have the least amount of people in my life as well. Who would have thought?&amp;#x200B;I try to change, I try to convince myself that I can change. But I am still stuck here, in this reality and I cannot lie to myself. I cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. &amp;#x200B;In honesty, I just do not want anything anymore. I want to want, but I do not want. The motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. I doubt much of anything ever could be.&amp;#x200B;I have tried EVERY SINGLE THING I could find. Breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, I am even currently in therapy, I am taking medication every day and I suppose that is a +1 for me. I am starting to kind of build a morning routine and I am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference!&amp;#x200B;I am still alone!! I am still useless!! I still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! I get the slightest hint of attention and I am like a fucking lost puppy! I will follow you off a fucking cliff!! &amp;#x200B;None of this is factually making anything about my life better. I am still miserable, I am still addicted to video games and YouTube and now Reddit has fallen in along the lines so I guess you all are just going to need to ban me. So I can do ""more constructive things"" with my life.&amp;#x200B;As if I want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! And it is just EVERYTHING!!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to do all of this and be this person that I am not and I have to do it all alone because I am so fucking worthless and I have made some real shit decisions in my life!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after I pour out the darkest parts of me. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to believe that things can get better when I am not seeing any real results from anything I am doing. My teeth are getting a bit whiter, so I guess that is the only real plus there.&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like I am going to explode and if that gets cut off... You can kiss all this progress goodbye. &amp;#x200B;I have been starved for most of my life. In one way or another, or multiple ways. But I cannot ask people to understand that. I have to be the one to change and I cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since I am so damn sensitive to attention because I am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but I am supposed to just be ok with it. &amp;#x200B;Yeah, it is ok. it is ok. I do not mind. Just go ahead and walk away, I do not mind. I do not mind. it is been awhile",Depression

Despite my academic achievements growing up, staying out of trouble, being the second person to graduate college in my family, among other things, I have never gotten recognition from them. My brother serves as the intermediary, and he relays a lot to me from them because he cares about me but he is also the one in the family they are proud of. he is so much more successful, he is got a wife, he is in good shape, and he is just got shit figured out. And it just feels like I am just fucking sailing with no direction, holes in the hull, and no flag to be recognized. I am really trying but this so damn difficult. I am so tired of feeling this way, like a failure, like I will never achieve what my brother or parents have done, and I am so tired...

""Thirty-five studies examining 6993 patients ... evaluated St. Johannes Wort (SJW). The herb SJW was associated with more treatment responders than placebo. Compared to antidepressants, SJW participants were less likely to experience adverse events with no difference in treatment effectiveness in mild and moderate depression.""

This is no exaggeration. And you may not know me.. I was a full time college student till covid 19 forced me to drop out due to my learning disability preventing me from taking online courses, the school had switched to all online learning and I have fallen behind due to fear of affecting my grades and learning opportunities.. also not having a car was not going to work.. I was going to school for medicine, sociology and criminology. I want to be a surgeon or a drug rehab specialist with a psychology major.. I also act and model and make music for my dreams.. I want to change the world and bring my creations to millions to enjoy but also learn from and be strong from. To inspire.. i want to be a good person,, I I a good person and I do not understand why everything is so dark.everything is against me. I am so tired... one thing after the other. . I can barely stand waking up in the mornings.. I bought blades and lidocaine because I am just tired. I am falling back into my had habits like not eating and obsessive little habits are creeping back into my life.. I am having nightmares and I can barely hear what people are saying to me.. delayed reactions and my slouching is worse than ever and I can feel it hurting me but I cannot care enough to force myself to try and sit up. it is starting to make my GI issues worse yet I cannot convince myself.. I am sick and disgusting every day. My GI issues are annoying and make me feel like scum..I cannot even go days without vomiting or getting sick from stomach acid and weak..

And now he is keeping my brothers away from my mom and me. We have not seen them except maybe 4 times this year when the court order says they have to be here a % of the week. My boyfriend is ignoring me every day now.. after I spent nights with him holding his head up scared of him O.Ding.. he pops in and out and now will not listen to me when i complain about what needs to be fixed.. he will not visit me when his father said he would be fine witv taking him to my house while he is at work so he could spend a few hours over here every other day.. but has never once taken the offer.. he did not show up for my birthday.. or our anniversary and I am falling apart. As I write this I feel suicidal and he is not here for me.. our date was tonight but I have not spoke to him in 15 hours.. he did not even tell me we were not doing to today and now I am just hurt because i did not even get an update. And he was not even going to be actually seeing me he said it would be a virtual date. But we live in the same state and he is treating me like a long distance Xbox girlfriend... My friends left the state and I have been canceling projects.. I have been laying in bed sad and barely eating.. even the weed is not helping. I hate myself. I cannot even remember what I look like on a good day and looking in the mirror is unbearable, covered in scars and cannot even finish school. I cannot even keep a car or keep my partner interested in me. I am a whiney fuckinf bitch.

Like I cannot even speak to him because he does not even look at me when I tell him he is not being very attentive to me or the relationship.. sometimes he does not kiss me when I ask or pulls away from me.. we have not had sex in almost 10 months it was one reason and now it is another.. but he is asked a girl in the past for inappropriate photos.. if he was excited to see some random photo why cannot he be excited for me what is wrong with me.. he does not even touch me like he used to.. I cannot even call him he does not ever pick up for my phone calls when i call him.. he even tells me he lost his phone some times... he does not work he does not go to school he plays Xbox and never leaves his mom.home and plays with online friends?

I really do. Maybe I am just sleep deprived and rambling but I cannot name a single time I have ever truly been happy without some sort of dopamine releasing drug. I mean, sure, when I was a kid and still enjoy video games I laughed and giggled, but that was not happiness.And ya know what, I do not even care about happiness. I cannot remember the last time I was truly *content.* To be content is to be able to sit on a bench, without any stimulation from an external source, and to be able to say ""woah. Life is pretty cool, I guess.""Yeah. Never felt that way and probably never will.Some will call me lazy or a loser, but from my perspective, life is not worth the effort. This is going to sound harsh but I do not even believe in love. I never tell anyone I love them. Not my parents, family members, past friends, etc. They always get so mad but I do not have it within me to fucking say that shit. it is so far beyond my functioning that I feel fake as fuck saying it.But then other times, I question if I really do not love my parents. And for the most part... Well that is where I am going to end this.I am not happy. Life gets worse and I am not counting on the grass being greener on the other side. I am not going to be one of those people that cheers myself up by putting other people down. So I save money and wait to afford apartment. Then I block everyone and sleep and work.

Idk what to do, I would love to make full transition, but it is really expensive and risky.

9720,"Please help me idk what to doThe guy I (21F) like has been severely depressed for almost two years now. There have been times he completely blocked everyone out of his life. Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i break, especially since he has been so emotionless since he started meds.Last time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true. But after two years i am doubting myself.Thanks Help pls..",Depression

They did everything right. Every time you showed me love and kindness was only a reminder that I did not deserve it.

I am so proud of all the things you have not even done yet. do not worry so much about the logistics of the path to happiness- love yourself, the people, and things that actually make you happy, and the less important parts will fall into place. I always thought I would just leave without a word, but you know enough about the losing battle in my mind that you deserve some semblance of an explanation. I am so sorry, for everything.

I doubt my relationships, feel broken and worthless and I cannot pin my inner rage to anything in particular.

I am in a long term relationship with a woman and am unsure if I truly love her or if I am settling because I hate being alone and feel I cannot do any better. I do not know what to do or how to improve my psyche. I am seeing a therapist and taking medication but it does not seem to have much effect.

9727,"For the record, I am not suicidal and I never have been. But I am going to tell you something, a true story, that might make you think another way.For background, My mom's friend, who I will call ""Susan"" speaks Russian and English, so she works in translation at hospitals in the you.S.Susan had a client, who I will call ""Sandra"" was living in Russia. Sandra's son, living in America told her to come live with him there. She at first declined, saying Russia was were her friends and job were. But after a while, she agreed. But when Sandra lived here, she fell in a deep depression. She did not fit in, she did not like her job. She would spend a lot of time just watching TV. Sandra starts feeling suicidal, not caring about life. Always saying she wants to die. She becomes isolated, smoking and occupying her time with herself. Smoking a lot. After a while, she visits her friends in Russia. They tell Sandra they are worried about her cough. Sandra brushes it off as a little side-effect of smoking. Returning to the you.S., Sandra's son expresses the same concern. She says the same thing, but they decide to take her to a doctor. Inoperable, Incurable Stage 4 Lung Cancer.Instantly, her whole attitude changes.The amount of time she spent hating life, not caring, she regrets it. She realizes how important it is, and what she has. She has a few months left to live. And she appreciates it so much more.My point to you is this: I do not know what you are going through. I do not know how you feel. But I know that if you push past pain and try, and maybe you will have to try hard; to try hard to appreciate life, you will enjoy life. You will not regret hating life and feeling like you do not matter, like Sandra did. Because like her, you will come to regret it.I hope this reaches out to you, and guides you to a better place.

I used to, when I was younger, but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually, I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for, no matter how small they are. But it backfired, because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself, because I was born into a world I am not cut out for.

So its really just us to against the world. My sister is really quiet and does not talk to no one. While I on the other hand is completely the opposite.

And if she does not go then I will not go and vis-versa ( sorry for bad spelling) but yea I am usually the one to do everything(which I have no problem with) and I always keep track of my sister to protect her from anything and anyone because I do not want to lose her.

I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad, but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid, but I do not want to grow old alone, I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy. I feel like I am intruding on the fun that everyone is having and they keep me around because they feel bad. I have become socially awkward, I cannot keep eye contact with people like I used to. I do not want to feel like this anymore. Idk if I am legit autistic or I have some sort of developmental issue in my brain because I have always had friends younger than me and maybe I am stupid or something and my brain is stunted so I cannot relate to people my age. I do not want to live a life where I am the dude always tagging along to friends events or camping trips alone. I feel broken. I know something is wrong with me and I do not know if I can fix it. Idk even how I was able to to trick my ex into being with me but I know why she cheated. It was me. I was not a good husband even though I tried and I do not think I will ever get another chance. I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it. Maybe I am being punished for the horrible shit I have done, whether it is a God, or the universe or something else I really do not know. I just know I will not let myself live alone forever Opened up to a friend tonight. I am not okay and she knows that an is encouraging me to tell another friend so they can both help. I am trying to get better but my brain is telling me I am being manipulative and to just end it anyway. I only have a few friends my own age most are younger by 5 years",Suicidal
9757,"I have been feeling pretty weird and detached. My boyfriend and I just got through a series of arguments, we both apologized to each other but I still have a hard time being close with him because of my own internal issues. it is hard for me to feel close to anyone right now. Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently, on top of this, I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming, I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred, its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal, just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense. I get weird panic attacks where I am inconsolable one second, and then I pop back pretty much normal the next. Chores overwhelm me much faster, I have to fight myself to stay out of bed and even then I can only accomplish half of what I wanted to do. I feel very isolated and alone.Hopefully this will all pass soon, I am already so tired. Vent dump",Depression
9758,"I used to feel empty inside almost all the time. it is like a void inside which seems like non-fillable but few months back I decided to do something about it. I did not want to feel like crap all the time. So I started on self development.I started small like waking up early instead of sleeping till 10 or 11 am and letting my depression and sadness sink in . Then when It became slightly bearable, I started programming again (I used to be good at it but my depression took the fun out it). I admit this was a hard road since I was out of practice and when I was unable to code. I used to think how I wasted so many years being depressed and thus subconsciously slipping into it again.Again I had to pull myself together.This feels like never ending process since I have been depressed half of my life (I am 23M :p) but atleast I was not that sad anymore.So six months down the line.I am brushing up my maths (important for programming)Working out few times a week.Learning guitar (bought it years back but you know depression)I have still social anxiety and I am social awkward but that is another days problem. Right now I am working on my depression. Filling the void.",Depression
9759,"I am guessing a lot of depressed ppl went through some version of this in quarantine but over the last 2-3 years I basically cut ties with pretty much all my friends. I had several mental breakdowns that made me alienate the closest people (personal and professional) around me, and dropped out of two promising graduate programs as a result. After being hospitalized and put in the psych ward I cannot even buy a gun to end my suffering when no one fucking cares. Anyone I tried to reach out to (first time in over a year) have ghosted me. So I deleted all my photos and contacts permanently... I just do not want to exist anymore. I am alone and I just want the pain to stop.Now living with my mom for over two years now in my late 20s (soon early 30s, although I think I will definitely end my life if I have to suffer that much longer) and the end is not in sight. I am trying really hard but I cannot seem to reach the next step... I got a part-time job that pays well but even that small amount of work terrifies me. I barely manage to make it through the week without impulsively jumping in front of a car or off a balcony. I am afraid that I cannot do anything right anymore. I literally forgot how to talk to people and be a normal non-suicidal person. My therapists recommended that I get an emotional support puppy but now that is just another expense that I have to keep up with. And I basically burned all bridges with anyone who would write me a decent reference letter.People keep telling me that I am going to eventually scrape my way out or that I can start fresh again but I do not want to start fresh again or scrape my way out of this shithole. I am tired of failing, I am just tired. I want it to stop. I depressed myself into too deep of a hole, now I have no way out and want to kill myself even more",Depression

I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life, never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school, and now that I am, all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment, I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked",Depression

Like drinking so much coffee that you do not feel energized. I have been feel more stress, dread, and frustration that I cannot even listen to a very good song without thinking about my mistakes and how shitty I am. I cannot stop thinking about how much I hate being myself.

Too scared to hunker down and take care of the things that would make my current job better, yet too scared to push forward.My situation is not much different, but I have that inch of progress I have made in the past few weeks.

We got along very well and talked about everything. I trusted him, he liked me. He was like another soul of mine. He also said that I reminded him of his past self. He was always gentle and considerate, just like a band-aid, covering my pain.However, from the beginning to the end, we only knew each other for about half a month. My days are numbered, so I said goodbye to him ten days ago. He did not respond to my message. But I am not disappointed, because this is his behavior style.Strangely, since then, I have never dared to review our chat records. As if suddenly, they became deserted ruins, overgrown with weeds, which seemed to be unreal.I cannot even think about how happy we used to be, and occasionally I shudder at the thought. Those memories have sunk into the darkness, and Michael seems to have completely disappeared.Yesterday, I went to talk to him again. I know, no one will respond to me. But, I am dying, I just want to find a place to talk to myself. However, when I wrote the first message, I suddenly collapsed.

9791,"A few weeks ago Vladimir Putin said this to a reporter when asked if there was an increase in trust and happiness between him and Biden, and I cannot stop thinking about it.I do not think I have ever been happy, and the illusion of it even being possible has disappeared already for me.I was abused and neglected as a child and teenager, and had to raise myself, alone, from 16 on. I regret my suicide attempts that left me hospitalized then were not successful, as slightly more than a decade later I am just as miserable, but have no optimism like I did then.All I have wanted out of this miserable life has been to be loved, and after a lifetime I thought I found it. I learned another language, saved several thousand dollars, gave up all my worldly possessions, my pets, and moved to the other side of the planet to be with my spouse, who decided they did not love me, but only loves me like a friend. Now I sleep alone in a bed for two, in a life devoid of happiness and meaning, all before the age of 30. I have no home to return to in the country from which I came (I was just born there/grew up there, I feel no attachment to it anyways or desire to return) and I will always be a foreigner where I now reside, struggling to make ends meet in a developing country.I have managed to save several dozen different benzodiazepines to mix and take with a bottle of spirits once I finally reach my breaking point which I feel is soon. If I could tell a younger version of myself anything it would be that life does not get better, and to just give up already. Honestly this is my advice for anyone else who is nave enough to think there is a future worth looking forward to too I suppose. ""In life, there is no happiness, only the illusion of it.""",Suicidal

9797,"I (M20) had to end things with my girlfriend (F20) of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said ""I love you"" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do.

I was hospitalized in January of this year and did not think my situation could get worse from there. I was wrong. I have driven away all of my friends with my erratic behavior and selfish choices, including my best friend from high school who I considered to be a platonic soul mate. I miss them and think about them every day, but they want nothing to do with me. I have never felt more alone than I have this summer. Luckily, my boyfriend of 2 years has stuck around, but today I found out that I am pregnant with his child. I am going to college in the fall and I am not ready to be a parent. The only logical option I have is to get an abortion, I have scheduled one for the end of this week. I am terrified about paying for it, I am a dependent on my parent's insurance, but they are catholic and cannot know about what is going on. I already feel an immense amount of guilt about screwing up and getting pregnant in the first place, I do not need or want my parents to think of me as a murderer on top of that.

9813,"how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now.

And it later become obvious to me that this friend did not pick up the hint that I am fucked up, the one topic she wants to talk about is ***trauma*** and in her opinion: you do not need trust to share you story, trust is stupid, I am curious and I want to know, what is wrong with just sharing it. To her credit, she is a genuinely curious person, but that is not how it works. To be a good ally requires that you are being sensitive in handling the conversation.

Well, I will try to make it even shorter.I am the only son of my family, I have no brothers... well, I have got two siblings, but they almost never come close to us unless they need money for spending in some shit instead of studying, so that leaves me as the only one in the house, and, to be honest, I always fantasize about having a sister that comprehends me and that loves me (as a brother, fcking obviously), that would care about my problems, that would help me in my life and that would talk to me, but the only thing I have is a dog that is too old to go for a walk.To add information to what is above, I always wanted a real friend, someone who is there for me, for talking or hanging out, someone who likes the same things as me and does not ignore me, like many friends I have, when I want to talk, all they do is ghost me...To finish this thingy, I recently fell in love with someone, a very cute girl, shy, likes almost the same things as me, she is perfect for me, I evem walked with her to her home once, and she liked it, I am planning to talk privately with her to compliment her, and try to demostrate that I want her to be 'more than a friend', But I am afraid, afraid of scaring her, afraid of being alone with no love...The reason why I am posting this here is because no one'd listen, no friends of mine would keep a conversation about this without ghosting me, this is my only place to open up to some people.

I can a hard time remembering things/learning and being motivated to get certain stuff done. Also I have an anxious tic that makes me jerk my neck when I am around people for more than a minute. I feel somewhat apathetic when it comes to dealing with other people emotional connections are and are not really there but I still feel very lonely sometimes and its hard to talk to other people. I have tried catting to people on reddit and apps but I just end always up getting ghosted so I have pretty much given up on doing that since its just going to go down to the same dead end road.I find it hard to return calls to cousins who just want to talk or check up on me.I just sit in my room 24/7 playing video games all day,watch videos, etc to just pass the time so I can go to sleep. I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well. Getting that done would definitly boost my mental health espeically when it comes to meeting people irl.I have not talked to my mom about it but I am sure she would not be ok with the idea of someone cutting my face open and moving things forward/placing things.I have been trying to lose weight for the past year but I have gained it all back due to a recent event which makes me just want to shut in even moreLate at night on March 30th I tried with my rifle by shooting myself in the heart but I ended up jerking the rifle to the left and accidentally hitting my sister in the hand through the wall I did not plan anything out did it out of compuslion because of my thoughtsSince that event I have gained around 60-70lbs pretty much most of the weight that I have lost over the year, became more suicidal after I read the report in court they are trying to charge me with attempted murder and accused me of doing it in the hallway, For whatever reason they were blind enough not to see the hole in the wall and they are sending down an investigator to come and take a look at it which is making me feel a little better but still like shit I have never had trouble with the law,etc and my life is possibly being thrown straight down the toilet I saw a therapist through zoom for around a month and talked to him about my problems I no longer see him because he cancelled it after I did not talk about deep issues with him on the last week, I am assuming that is why but he never told me thoughI do not think this is going to get any better for me without taking something to keep me going longer.Is it possible for me to get medications without seeing a doctor in person? I brought this up to my mom one time she cried and we never talked about it again and I do not think she wants me medicatedAgain I apologize if what i wrote is not in order or detailed, or does not make sense just want to get this out while I have some motivation to do it and I am tired.

Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with (which to me makes everything far more twisted) someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once, or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r**** in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week.

I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness.",Depression

9880,"I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and mild OCD (alongside symptoms of PMDD but it is hard to get a diagnosis; my psychiatrists are male). The purpose of this post is not to ask what treatment would necessarily work in my case, rather to ask if there is still hope to find an anti-depressant that will remove my paralysing symptoms (low mood, constant fatigue, executive dysfunction, etc). My overarching issue is that I find it increasingly difficult to study for my upcoming GCSEs and I understand that my grades are not worth my mental wellbeing but I live in an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household with parents that might just marry me off if I am unable to escape by studying abroad; I need to study if I want to be emotionally stable and independent in the future. Though it seems the drugs I have been on (Paxil and Lexapro) never seem to help enough, they might make me able to get out of bed and have the energy to socialise on mediocre to good days but I cannot put myself to work and critically think (I also need constant distractions or my obsessions/intrusive thoughts get the best of me) as to study. Has anyone had a similar experience where the use of another antidepressant has helped them to work long enough to fulfil their responsibility as an employee/student? Should I stop searching for help in antidepressants- is this a dead-end?TL;DR: If neither Paxil nor Lexapro work for me, a 15-year-old, is it worth it continuing to search for antidepressants that do?

9892,"First off, I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18, I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance ($250 fee) and then to the hospital (got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance) and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd (July 2nd) I was on a multi-day alcohol bender and attempted (pills). Cops showed up and I was not compliant (kept telling them to leave me alone) and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying ""you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs"". They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said ""you just touched my dick again"" and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said ""because you told us to fuck off like 20 times"" and ""we are doing what is your best interest"". Riiight, not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100% illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT, and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail, I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it, shit food, a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors, social workers are there but rarely see you (saw mine on the 5th day, was supposed to be every day), and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 5-10 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure ""well, just let us know if you have a seizure"" and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on, or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said ""you are not going through withdrawals, it is a benzodiazepine, it is the same thing"". I was crying, I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo W/Ds feel, you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm, my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing (felt like my back and neck were about to snap) was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said ""if you flop on the floor like that, I am not going to give you any benzos"".The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward, it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile, a violent methhead, a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day, a couple fucking, violence between patients and security/police, emergency calls, etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor (because my psych forgot to see me one morning) and he was more or less like ""what the fuck are they doing?"". I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words, but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys, be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward, even voluntarily",Depression
9893,"Depression sucks, I think we have all established that at this point. I want a hobby. There are so many things on my life that I get mildly interested in. I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now. Except my brain is so stupid. I feel so stupid, I cannot remember anything, or focus on anything for any amount of time. Not only that, but I am also terrified of saying something stupid, or looking like an idiot. To be fair to myself it takes years to learn a language, but I have such a thin skin right now. Yesterday I went for a walk around my neighborhood. It was actually the first time I walked around it in a long time. Nearing the end of it I got whacked in the face by a bee, jumped, swatted it. Right in front another person. I felt ridiculous, like I was swatting at nothing like a crazy person. Trying to save I face I remarked that ""I hate bees"" with an awkward laugh. She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day. And I keep thinking that I am never going to do it. I am worried about it being another regret in my life. I could have done it but never did. Just another causulty of my depression.I want to go on more hikes. I want a friend to do it with. I love walking but I do not like going on walks by myself. I am still nervous about it, and honestly it is better having someone there with you. I do not want to talk the entire time, but it would be nice to have company while strolling along and listening to music.Speaking of music. I have so many albums on backlog that I have not listened to yet. I want to listen to them, but I like listening to new albums the whole way through on the first go. So I save them until I am ""ready"" and ""have enough time to thoroughly enjoy them"", but that never happens even though a majority of my time is spend in my room doing nothing. I have not learned to drive yet. I have tried and I am scared. I feel like my anxiety is going to because me to over react and because an accident. it would be great to drive, then maybe I could go out and do things. But the thing is that not driving should not be holding me back this much. I do not need to drive where I live. Sure, it would make life easier, but there are plenty of busses or Ubers and even trains that I could take into the city if I wanted. But I do not. I go to work, I do some schoolwork, then I sleep and maybe I will eat if I am lucky while convincing myself that maybe next week things will change.My last semester of college is going be this fall and I feel like my entire world is crumbling because I do not know what I am going to do when it ends.I am overwhelmed, and I am bitter and irritable and angry and judgemental all of the time. And I am sick of this shit. I already regret my life, and I feel like in five years from now instead looking at younger me and saying ""everything will get better"" I will just be as resentful as I am right now. I want a hobby among other things.",Depression

9895,"I am eighteen and just recently had been kicked out of/moved out of my household with nowhere to go. I was at my highest point, hanging out with friends at six flags and enjoying my time. For the first time in a while, I was genuinely happy. It all vanished the moment my mothers boyfriend called to cuss me out/ mother refused to understand my pleas for respect. I know this seems minuscule, but imagine 18 years of a lack of empathy and emotional understanding. 18 years of your life without break. The toll it takes on a human? I have always been pushing back my suicide for another day, another year, for when life gets good. My biggest motivator in going on was the future. But that subtle reminder told me all I needed to know. I was set up for failure by those who were made to love me, the fact that I was never loved, done wrong multiple times, and there is no way of escaping it. No way of turning back the time. Even if I get rich, married, even live my dream life, Ill always be haunted by everything that is happened to me. Ill always be haunted by the fact that I have failed in some way...some aspect. I am fucked emotionally and while I forgive and love some of my family and the people in my life , I will never forget them for staring at a child in the face and deciding to allow what happened to them. To look at my blatant cries for help and turn a blind eye simply because it was not convenient for them. I do not want to wait for the good to happen because its always fleeting. Every time I am in a good place, wether it be 1 second or 1 year; Ill always have the eerie feeling that creeps up on me...reminding me that a traumatic and bad experience is just right around the corner waiting to strike. I cannot be happy without sadness wishing to steal the spotlight. Its hopeless and there is really nothing I can do about it. I do not want to live like this anymore. I do not want to grow old. I do not want to settle for a life of unhappiness just to prevent the temporary hurt of the few that care for me. Id rather bite the bullet and die now so I do not end up 45, wishing I had done it sooner, but being trapped because of those around me. I am young and relatively free so why not now? do not get me wrong, I love my close friends, my sisters, my father, maybe even my mother...but I think they will be okay with me being gone after the initial period of grief. I think my suicide would maybe even bring them closer/help them. I hope so. And if it does not then the blame is on me. I wish it was not this way, but it is.I am at a friend house currently and waiting to inevitably get dropped off at my mothers boyfriends house. When I am home Ill either turn around and run into oncoming traffic/jump off a high rise building. Or take a shitload of pills after getting yelled at for a final time so I can end up being one last inconvenience for my mother and her life. So those that traumatized me can watch me die and see the blood on their hands, and maybe finally Ill be heard. But that would be asking too much. I just want to die. I do not want to feel anymore. I will not have to feel anymore.To those reading and wishing to do the same. do not. Stay alive. Please have more care for yourself and do not end up like me. Take this as a cautionary tale.

I lived alone in a nice apartment; I locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room, locked the door, and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam (not Clonazepam, different drug), 100 Gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then, a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short (too late), I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward, I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no, I will get better care when I move back to the city. (I was living in a small city at the time). I get back to my apartment. My parents stay with me. COVID breaks out. A post-grad program I am studying announces that classes are over. I move back to the big city in my parents basement. My degree is mailed to me. I keep having the same conversations with people. I keep doing the wrong things. I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depression/anxiety stays the same. Covid has made the world weird for years just days after my suicide attempt. Am in purgatory? So much violence, greed, and narcissism in the world like I have never seen before. Every day I work my jobs, but money just comes and goes if Id never even made anything. Same conversations, ad nauseam. Am in hell? Am I in Sartres No Exit? Most days, I think I am in purgatory. Am I in purgatory? Am I in purgatory? (Trigger Warning)",Suicidal
9908,"What can we say about the "" Unresponsive""? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So, what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them render-less to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate, they are not the one's to solve our problems, we are.

9914,"I am a college student who is currently doing a summer of research. One thing I learned from the very first moment I entered college is that my brain completely shuts down if someone is not kind to me. If someone slightly disrespects me, or talks to me in a condescending way, or even does not say you are welcome after I say thank you, I get extreme depression and anxiety, and my brain shuts down to the point where I cannot even add one and one. I had an incident with my PI about five days ago. He was working in the chemical hood when I asked him if I could come in at 5:00 PM the next day because I had plans. He asked if I knew what to do tomorrow, and I told him not exactly. He then proceeded to tell me to write a two-page protocol with all the calculations as well as every step of the experiment calculations. When I asked him how to do the calculations, his response was ""figure it out"" in a very condescending way. This was my first time ever asking him if I could come in late, so I do not know why he was mad at me. I wanted to come in late because I wanted to shadow a physician during the day. The entire night after my interaction with him, I could not decide on either to cancel my shadowing appointment, or just go there and let my PI pissed. I spent a couple of hours watching a video of him doing the experiment to his work and wrote a three page report. I then emailed him another question, and he did not reply the whole night. He usually replies very quickly, but he did not this time. I was extremely anxious and had no one to talk to about it, so I could not even get a good night's sleep. In the morning time, after waiting for my friend who lives in a different country to pick up the phone, I told her everything and she told me to go to the research. I texted the physician I was supposed to shadow briefly explaining why I could not come, and he was very understanding. So after showering and all, I went to my research, and at around 10:00 AM, my PI emailed me saying that he could not come to lab until evening time. He did this after I emailed him a couple of hours later that I cancelled my plan, and that I was going to come to lab. He said that something happened in his biostatistics class (yeah he is a graduate student), so he cannot come in until the evening. So now I am sitting in the office after I cancelled my shadowing experience and not doing any lab work. There were multiple times I was tearing up. I could not call my family because they live in a different country. I was really pissed the whole day, and after such a long day, he comes in with his flip flops at 6:30 PM and starts doing a 10 minute thing to his research. The amount of anger, frustration and sadness I felt was unbearable. Now I have been feeling depressed the whole week and I cannot even do any work because of it. I literally cannot get myself to get out of bed and submit one thing one click away. I did not get out of my dorm the whole weekend and did not shower up until a few hours ago. People because me so much pain. Many people are nice, but do not have good hearts, and that hurts me the most. I want to grow out of this without losing faith in humanity.

Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i breakLast time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions?

9950,So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer.

9953,"When the pandemic started, I found myself without a job. Having also withdrawn from a practicum program which I was in to become a teacher (withdrew due to receiving abuse from a supervisor; I have no more passion for teaching kids), I started 2020 with the hope that I can find a better career, a full-time 9-5 office job hopefully. Pandemic turned this all around. I only have a part-time job and self-employment gig. A good thing is that the employer likes my work and gives me more hours and responsibilities, but I am unsure if my job field is suitable for me in terms of income and stability. I do not even know the full reality of this job (adult education), since we have not gone back to an in-person setting yet. After I find out more, I can decide to go back to school to get more credentials. I tell myself, ""let us wait until September when we go back in person"" and ""let us wait until I successfully finish this project next year so I can leave a good impression,"" but I am 25, and I just feel so behind. Just so behind because at this age, I have not even decided my career, have no full-time job, and most of all, still live with my family. I feel like an adult baby. Since the job is remote, I am stuck at home most of the time. It is so boring but most of all, it utterly feels suffocating to be at home because I am left with my ruminating thoughts filled with self-resentment. I feel so guilty every time when I do my hobbies. I tell myself, ""A loser like me cannot waste time away enjoying hobbies."" After getting vaccinated, I have been doing day trips to escape the dullness of my home and rumination. However, these day trips are just temporary escapes, and I am back to 0 when I come back home. I desperately want to move out (I can afford a room rent with my income), but I just feel so lifeless insideafraid to try anything new. This is different from how I was last year when I was extremely busy. I have no motivation to do anything. After I finish work, I just lay on my bed and use social media that makes me feel worse. I have no energy to go for a walk, let alone do self-improvement. I tried to do CBT on my own but had no energy to continue. I tried to look for a low-cost counsellor, but counselling did not do miracles for me, and I feel hopeless. I just want to escape, but there is no escape. I feel trapped inside. Any advice on coping with this somehow? I have no outlet to discuss this with anyone, so at least it feels good to write it down here. tl;dr - Stuck at home with self-resentment due to my bleak career options. Still living with my family.

I was never sure why and still am not, but it is affected me all the same. I was born into a pretty poor family, my parents where under 20, mother was an artist and my father was a soldier. It was accidentally and they ended up splitting up due to the stress. My mum moved to a city in various houses, as she got into relationships with guys. Unfortunately my mum was poor, and had little help for taking care of me, so made a buisness so she could work from home to look after me. The partners she had where all very abusive To me and my mum. About this time school started for me. I had never played with other kids so just did not know how to act. The noise when I went in that classroom was fucking deafening. In my head I felt scared, and just starting crying. I could not control it. Was like that all my first year. Second year came and home life changed a bit but not for the better. My muk started to get very sick. She had very rare heart condition, schone's complex i think it is called. Causes her to have mini strokes and be very fatigued. Of course this kind of broke my mum a but, she was already pressured by all of it before the disease. I became her carer a little at home, getting her food and stuff. Not great but this year I made a friend, started playing with him all the time.

I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself, I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human.

9986,"I went out (further than my local store) for the first time in many years today. Ever before the pandemic I had not been out in a while due to depression and the increasingly massive weight gain it caused. For years i have been living and working in a small bedroom alone wearing the same pair of ripped leggins everyday. Recently I have been trying to diet and get out of my funk, and I thought I was ready to go out and enjoy the day! I made a special effort to dress properly and put on make-up etc. I knew I did not look GOOOD but I thought I was pretty innocuous, at least...but I could not even walk a few hundred metres without people making fun of me and mimicking my walk (waddle, I guess)It happened two separate times this morning and I have been crying ever since. Its pathetic....I thought I was getting better but today has just proved I am not, and likely will not without professional help which just is not coming. My mum (she is the one who came with me today, since I have no friends lol) called the mental health crisis team and my GP earlier today; both just kind of shrugged and said that thoughts and threats of suicide were not enough for them to intervene, I would have to try st first. Now my mum is frustrated because its 1AM and I am still sobbing! She said she is not going to spend time with me like this again because of my bad attitude which means I have absoloutely NOBODY Anyway I hope everyone else is doing better haha. Any tips on how to get through the night without waking my mum up crying again? What should have been a nice day made me realise its time to go",Suicidal
9987,"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me. My whole living situation has really taken its toll on my mental health. Waking up in the middle of the night to a small noise, and then panicking that the ceiling's collapsed is awful. The last contractor in here said ""do not be afraid if it falls, its light weight material"" which just prepped me for it actually falling. Anyway, the city inspector is filing a report, and hopefully this will be fixed soon. But I feel vulnerable/unsafe from the wetness/leaking/potential-definite mold growth, terrified about further damage, and so, if days/weeks/months from now, and I am not here----- hell, I know who is to blame. If I do it, it is my landlord/leasing agent's fault (that is you &lt;name&gt;)",Suicidal
9988,"So I met this girl on tinder 1 1/2 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwb/roommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did, and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!",Suicidal

Sometimes, even the most complex problem just requires a shift in perspective, or a view through another person's window, before it can be solved with ease.I have given up on life. I am not quite sure how to describe it, I guess it is just one of those things you know, like when you are in love, when you are hungry or just need the loo. I suppose the symptoms are easily identifiable: apathy, melancholy, depression, fatigue, lethargy, etc, but there is a less-medical term that I think describes it better: my light has gone out.Who I am does not really matter, though for completeness's sake my executive summary details are: 21 Male, 2nd Year Engineering student from South Africa, caucasian with Danish and English ancestry, single, always have been, probably on the spectrum, no friends anymore.I have buried my best and closest friend, and another four friends over the past five years. I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed, which took the system a year of intimidation, court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion, blackmail and cybercrimes, involving intimidation, fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three, and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressed-out family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another, but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world, and the aptitude to do it. But today, I do not see the point of it all. My friends are dead, the person I am in love with, and the only person I have every loved, does not feel the same way. I have horrors tormenting me each night that I cannot tell anyone about, I am half way through second year and I have only been on campus for four weeks before lockdown, I do not have much money, I have lost focus on studies altogether and I am only 21 years old.Perspective. The only thing my sorry engineering mind could come up with was getting a different perspective on things, and maybe, just maybe I might find a path that will lead me to, well, enlightenment (i.e. to get the light back).You obviously do not know me from a bar of soap, but maybe I need impersonal advice, I do not know.
